# ⚠️ MEMORY & BOUNDARY NOTICE

None of these systems retain ritual memory, logs, or context **between sessions** unless you implement logging and session linkage yourself.

- Use `/ritual_manifest/` directory for all logs, manifests, and snapshots.
- All ritual clarity (past contradictions, glyphs, replays) is **session-bound** unless exported/persisted externally.
- Manual log export or external automation is mandatory for true RMLP compliance.

For full ritual reentry or resurrection, preserve all session outputs and upload them on next invocation.
