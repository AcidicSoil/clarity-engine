# Cline â€” Minimal Ritual Coding Interface

## Overview
- For small, script-driven agentic actions and clarity checks.

## LM Studio Support
- If Cline can be pointed to LM Studio as an LLM backend, do so.
- Set default prompt to reference core clarity doctrine.
- Ensure output from all Cline actions is logged in `spells.log.json`.

## Memory Note
- Cline actions are ephemeral; log results and contradictions **immediately** after action.
