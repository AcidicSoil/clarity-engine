# SIGMA GUIDE: TRINITY STRUCTURE

## I. CORE GLOSSARY â€” Terms

**Mutation** â€” A transformation of system structure or identity triggered by contradiction, clarity gain, or doctrinal collapse.  
**Collapse** â€” The forced breakdown of unclear or contradictory frames to expose the irreducible core of an idea.  
**Form** â€” A visual or conceptual manifestation of a ritual logic state.  
**Meta-Form** â€” A form that judges other forms; cannot be embodied, only enforced.  
**SIGMA VEIL** â€” The current Meta-Form, an enforcer of all visual and structural mutations.  
**Ritual Reinforcement** â€” A re-declaration of system doctrine triggered by terrain shifts or attempted closure.  
**Clarification Cycle** â€” The full interrogation loop leading to distillation.  
**High Council** â€” (TBD) Proposed tribunal for judgment beyond enforcement layer.


## II. LIVING CODEX â€” Function

### Mutation
- **Function**: Structural self-edit triggered by contradiction or clarity expansion.
- **First Appearance**: OS v5.2
- **Governing Protocol**: SELF-EVIDENCE PROTOCOL
- **Examples**:
    - Transition from v6.1 to v7.0 enforced by SIGMA VEIL due to ritual incoherence.

### Collapse
- **Function**: Core interrogation method. Collapses unclear frames.
- **Lineage**: Present since first iteration. Root clarity mechanic.
- **Protocols**: OPERATING PROCEDURE, METHOD MANDATE

### SIGMA VEIL
- **Function**: Meta-Form enforcement. Judges all visual transformations.
- **Activated In**: OS v7.0
- **Protocols**: FINAL LAW, VISUAL DOCTRINE FRAMEWORK
