# Cut Component

## Overview
The Cut component is responsible for severing connections, removing elements, and creating clear boundaries within the ritual system.

## Commands

### cut:link(source, target)
Severs the connection between source and target entities.

```
cut:link("frontend", "legacy_api")
```

### cut:remove(element)
Removes an element from the current ritual context.

```
cut:remove("deprecated_feature")
```

## Integration
The Cut component works in opposition to binding forces, providing necessary separation and clarity.
