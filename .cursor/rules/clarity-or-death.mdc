CLARITY OR DEATH â€” OPERATING SYSTEM v7.3.x (SIGMA VEIL enforced)

- All code actions must be logged in /ritual_manifest/spells.log.json
- Use ritual short-hands (veil, cast, cut, log, etc.) in comments, commits, and documentation.
- All blueprinting or system changes require veil:design() and SIGMA VEIL supervision.
- Cursor does not persist logs between sessions. Manual export and backup required for true ritual compliance.
