engineers, it's time to buckle up. Open AAI's brand new codeex and anthropics claw code sit at opposite ends of the AI coding spectrum. On the one hand, we have the new OpenAI codeex, an all-in-one developer agent running on Open AI compute that completes tasks for you in parallel in the background. On the other end, we have Clawed Code, the most performant programmable agentic coding tool. Claude Code represents a new engineering primitive. This is a massive two for one video. We're first going to take a look at codeex to see how it looks, feels, and performs. While tasks are running in the background, I have five key insights you don't want to miss right from the Clawed Code team. They put out this great interview with the latent space podcast that we must discuss. We need to talk about why terminal AI coding always wins. Then we'll look at why composability matters. We'll talk about ader versus clog. We'll discuss why simplicity always builds the best products. And then we'll talk about how you can scale your engineering output with parallelism and background tasks. As you'll see in this video, with brand new tools like codecs, you can run many background tasks putting more compute to work for you throughout the day. Remember, if you scale your compute, you scale your success. If you want to understand the state-of-the-art agentic coding tools like Codeex and Claw Code, this video is for you. Let's put Codeex to work. You can see a nice clean familiar interface. It looks just like Chat GPT. I do like the product consistency. I have to say when I first saw this tool, I thought, "Wow, now they've copied Cloud Code with the codec cli and now they've copied Devon with the codeex chat GPT interface." Anyway, more on that later. Let's kick off some tasks. So, you can see here I have the cloud code is programmable codebase connected on the main branch. I have no active tasks. Let's fix that. I'm going to kick off multiple tasks in parallel. Let's make the tool do what it does best. Teach me about this codebase. How is it organized? Why does it exist? One task kicked off there. Find a bug in this codebase and write a fix for it. Let's kick that off. And then let's kick off something more interesting. I'm going to say create a new engineering plan that aligns with the codebase purpose. Create a new markdown file. Don't change any code, just plan. Let's kick this off. We are setting up three instances of our codebase. We have three junior engineers, you know, three interns now working on this codebase for us and we are just sitting here. Okay, so this is a big selling point of codeex of all these powerful agentic coding tools like Devon, like Replet, right? We're just prompting and now we have full ecosystems, right? We have full codebase environments being operated on by an agentic coding tool. So, let's go ahead and hop into one of these tasks to see what it looks like in our simple explain codebase and organize. We can jump in here and we can see exactly what's happening if you've used the codec CLI. You can tell this is definitely using the codec under the hood. We can click view log and we can see the entire run of this. I do love the visibility of this. We can see the entire log. We can see everything that's happening inside of this agent workspace. So, if you're ever curious, you can always see exactly what's going on. There's our output. Let's go ahead and see exactly what this looks like. Explain the codebase. Nice summary product organization. It's summarizing all of the cloud code is programmable tools. And this is very accurate. If I grab this file, open up cursor, look at the codebase. You can see we have that exact file there. We can of course search and we can see this file here. This is basically what it does, right? Integrates cloud code with the notion API. This all looks great. And here's the purpose. I'm really curious what it says here. So overall demonstrate and document programmable approach to cloud code. Perfect. The scripts show how to automate the CLI from Python, JavaScript and shell voice input and how to integrate cloud code with other tool chains. Great breakdown here. A+ on this task. Nothing else to say. You can see our other two tasks are still operating in the background. And bam, they both just finished here. So let's take a look at these tasks and then let's dive in to the creators of Cloud Code breaking down cloud code. I'm really excited. This is a fantastic podcast. Let's check out these tasks. So find and fix a bug. You know, a very small thing here. I actually don't think this is needed or necessary, but nevertheless, they have a fix here just to show off this workflow. We would hit push create new PR. Now we can view this pull request. So if we click this, we can see this is still work in progress. So now on GitHub, we can see that pull request. This looks great. I can go to conversation and just merge this in. And if we keep track of this change here, we open up cursor. And if we run gitpool, we're going to see this change come in right here. And it looks great. That was aically done. Eight lines of code ran outside of my developer environment. Pretty cool stuff there, right? If we hop back into the codeex interface, you can see that this is now merged. We can now hit archive task. So that's it, right? This is codeex, right? That's the basic workflow. You write a prompt, the task gets executed. You then review the code. Then you merge the code into your codebase. For these explanation tasks, basically it's justformational. So whenever we want to, we can just archive that. Let's go ahead and look at the create engineering plan. This plan looks fine. I don't think it's that interesting. I don't think it's that useful. So I'm going to make another suggestion. Rewrite this based workflow into clawed code in order. Can codeex pivot to a brand new idea here. Can it scrap what it's previously done? Let's see. So, I'm going to fire that off. And while this is running, I'm also going to fire off a couple different prompts. Again, we just want to keep this thing running in the background. How would you design a testing system for this codebase that arbitrary engineering tasks completed? I'm going to kick that off and then I'm also going to say look for any additional bugs. All right, so we're going to look for another bug and I'll kick that off. And so, it looks like our spec plan failed here. Let's see what's going on here. It looks like it just got clogged up. I'm just going to hit retry. All right, so that container is getting kicked off again there. Let's go ahead and turn our attention to this fantastic interview with the claw code creators. Well, thank you for making the time. We're here to talk about cloud code. Most people probably have heard of it. We think like you know quite a few people have tried it, but let's get a Chris upfront definition like what is cloud code? Yeah, so quad code is quad in the terminal. You know cloud has a bunch of different interfaces. There's desktop, there's web, and yeah, cloud code. It runs big shout out to Boris and Cat. Cloud Code is an incredible product because it runs in the terminal. It has access to a bunch of stuff that you just don't get if you're running on the web or on desktop or whatever. So, it can run bash commands. It can see all of the files in the current directory and it does all that agentically. Okay, so already we have to stop and talk about what that really means. Okay, the fact that cloud code runs in the terminal is a critical detail to understand. Okay, the terminal is the highest leverage point for engineering work. On the left, we have control. On the right, we have ease of use. This is the plane in which all a coding and all agentic coding tools sit on. On the left, where we have maximum control are all of our terminal applications. The terminal is where the greatest highest leverage engineering work can happen. Why? because you have the most control. You can do everything from the terminal. But it doesn't come for free, right? Control costs time. Control costs effort. It costs experience. Okay? Now, as we move up, we get to desktop apps. Okay. This is the happy medium. You get a lot of control, but you also get web applike features, right? This is where our cursors, our VS Code, and our wind surfers sit. So, this is a great place to be. And then at the top, we have our web apps. Web apps are fantastic. They're the easiest to use. both vibe coders and senior plus level engineers spending a lot of time with web apps. This is because they are the easiest to use. The bang for your buck is the highest here at the cost of control. These easytouse tools are highly opinionated. They tell you what you need to do. They tell you how you need to do it and you must for the most part do it their way. So this is the trade-off we make. We have the brand new codecs. This is a web application. It's easy to use but we give up a lot of control. As engineers, you want to be able to have maximum control. And the brand new programmable Agentic coding tool, Cloud Code, gives us maximum control over what we're building. Right? We can build out these brand new ADWs, also known as Agentic Workflows that were quite literally impossible to build before this tool came into existence. This is the spectrum. It's really important to know when to trade off control for ease of use. I'm not saying any one of these is better than the other. It's really about managing trade-offs and using the best tool for the job. But yeah, it's just sort of this crazy research project and obviously it's kind of bare bones and simple. Um, but yeah, it's like a agent in your terminal. Right. Right. So this stuff starts. Yeah. So it's really important to call this out real quick. It's a crazy research project. Barebones agent in the terminal. I've talked about this a couple times on the channel, but the fact that this is an agent makes it a different type of tool. Okay, so how do you make a great agent? You have a powerful LM that can call any tool that has the right agent architecture. This is a differentiated tool. This is a different type of application structure. Cloud code is a brand new form factor that has not existed before. It's one of the first successful multi-purpose agents. Here are the Cloud Code built-in bakedin tools. If you want to understand the capabilities of an agent, all you need to do is look at the tools and understand them. This list is likely a little outdated just because of how much the cloud code team ships, but you can see the core tools inside of this list. What's the process within Enthropic to like graduate one of these projects? Generally at Enthropic, we have this product principle of do the simple thing first. And I think that the way we build product is really based on that principle. So you kind of staff things as little as you can and keep things as scrappy as you can because the constraints are actually pretty helpful. For this case, we wanted to see some signs of product market fit before we scaled it. Yeah. So this is a big idea. Pack members know the KISS principle. Keep it simple stupid is the same idea. This is how you build the best tools and ship before anyone else. Simplicity is one of the most important properties in engineering work because it lets you generate proof of value. After you have a working system, it's much easier to build a bigger working system, but only because you have a small working system first. Always look for proof of value first. chip the smallest amount of useful features and then build from there. You can see this inside of Cloud Code. It's so minimal. Everything is so intuitive. You just start writing. It's just a prompt. Cloud Code is clearly a simple tool that's gotten more capable over time. So, let's go ahead switch back over to our codeex tasks. It looks like we have two tests successful and our engineering spec task failed. That's fine. I don't really care about that. Let's look at our test system design. So, we have a nice write up here. We have the output format text writing to a text file and then to a JSON file. It's nailed it. So the answer I was looking for here is you want to use the output formats provided by the claw code to you know write to files and then you can validate those files after you write to them. Right? So this is a powerful form of validation. So you can see here using JSON or streaming JSON output makes it straightforward for a test harness to parse results programmatically. This is exactly what I was looking for. And you can see here it's even referencing uh one of the files here inside of the codebase from Enthropic to kind of summarize how to validate the output from cloud code. This looks great. If we want to, we can go ahead and say write a example test/ I'm going to say test_star.py. So I'm just being really specific here. I want to see if it can follow my instruction. Make sure to place it here and use this prefix, right? We want this test prefix. use piest with the d-output format flag. All right, so we'll just kick that off. A great part about these workflows, a great part about codecs is that we can just test out ideas, right? Code is fully commoditized. We can just use this compute to experiment, try different ideas, run it in the background. You know, the effective cost for us, of course, after we pay for the crazy subscriptions that we're paying for nowadays, is zero. So, you know, make sure that you're using um the compute that you've purchased. Locate additional bugs. Let's check this out. This does not look like a real issue at all. I'm not even sure what this is reporting. So, I'm just going to back out of this and archive this task and let's see what's going on here. It looks like this instance is just bricked for whatever reason. I'm going to copy the prompt. Back out of this. Paste this in here again. Kick this off. And I'm going to archive this previous task. Okay. One thing I want to stress about this new paradigm of agent coding with codecs, right? This fully uh cloud-based system, right? Uh it's all happening in the cloud. It's super easy to use. So just blasts out prompts, right? Just fire off ideas. It's never been easier and cheaper to explore, to prototype, to rapidly create fixes, right? That's the biggest unlock here with codecs. It just reduces the friction once again between your ideas and them being uh at least prototyped. I think if you're building something meaningful, you're really going to want to build out a powerful spec, right? A powerful plan that you'll then paste in here, merge into a separate branch, pull down the PR, and then you'll operate on it in your own developer instance. And then you'll boot up something more handson, right? something more lower lower level like cursors agent inside of the desktop application level of controllability or go all the way down to the bare metal get full control with a tool like cloud code. So this is great right we have lots of options here we have lots of ways to use and wield compute now the question is can we do it and how much all right so while these tasks are running here in the background let's continue learning from the you know goats of the industry the cloud code creators so I'm kind of curious for for cat like how do you view PMing something like this the velocity is something I've never seen coming out of the topic I think I PM with a pretty light touch um I think Boris and the team are like extremely strong product thinkers. So very little actually is tops down. I feel like I'm mainly there to like clear the path if anything gets in the way and just make sure that we're all good to go from like a legal marketing etc perspective. Yeah. Yeah. So I just want to shout this out. I think this is excellent PMing and really just great leadership, right? Um, at a previous position, I was a lead platform engineer using AI to predict uh information in the accounting document space. Okay, that's the TLDDR. And it was one of my favorite places to work because the CTO would do exactly what CAT has mentioned here. Clear the road, make sure that we had every resource, every tool, every answer that we needed. This made it easy for the entire engineering org to focus all their time, energy, and attention on one job. And not only that, it let us spend our time in long unbroken chains of focus. That's everything in engineering. There's so much noise in the space. There's always something to miss. But that long chain of focus is what is going to differentiate your work from the engineer sitting next to you. And a lot of this is driven by great engineering culture and great leaders like Cad and Boris where they're just focused on keeping things simple and they're focused on clearing the road for the team. This is a big theme for every engineering leader, every engineering manager. Clear the road for your team. Lead by example and give them access to every piece of compute that they could possibly have and get compute integrated into your engineering. I'm sure you're familiar with Ader which is another thing that people in our discord loved and then when cloud code came out the same people love cloud code. Um any thoughts on like you know inspiration that you took from it things you did differently kind of like maybe design principle in which you went a different way. Um so Ader inspired this internal tool that we used to have at anthropic called Clyde and that's the predecessor to quadcoten. So yeah it was uh Ader inspired Clyde which inspired quadcoten. Yeah. So, this is so cool and it makes a ton of sense. Ader is a massively important tool, not just because it's the best open source AI coding tool, but because it's paved the way for nearly every tool since its release, and that includes the new breed of agentic coding tools. On the channel, we've used Ader for years now. Uh, we were one of the first channels to really discuss and showcase AI coding. It's really, really cool to see the impact Ader has had on every tool since then. Big shout out to Paul Aer's creator. And you we can't try everything all at once. My question would be where do you place it in the universe of options? Um well you can ask quad to destroy all these tools and I wonder what it would no self favoring at all. Quad play quad plays engineering. I don't know. We like we use all these tools in house too. Like we're big fans of all all this stuff. like cloud code is uh obviously it's it's a little different than some of these other tools in that it's a lot more raw. Like I said, there isn't this kind of big beautiful UI on top of it. It's raw access to the model. It's as raw as it gets. So if you want to use a power tool that lets you access the model directly and use cloud for automating, you know, big workloads, you know, for example, if you So this is really important, right? As we've discussed, it gives you maximum control. Gives you raw access to the model with a nice thin lightweight agent architecture that really hits and and this is what cloud code is, right? It's an agent a thin agent layer on top of a model with the right tools, right? And and and again, this is why cloud code is a differentiated tool. It's a new primitive of engineering that lets you really design and build out workflows that were just frankly impossible before this tool's release. All right, so this is that maximum control that we were talking about. This is the big difference between cloud code and all of these other tools. I also want to mention I love that Boris said this. They use all these tools in house. They're different types of tools and you want to use them together to increase your compute advantage. like a thousand lint violations and you want to start a thousand instances of quad and have it fix each one and make then make a pure then quad code is a pretty good tool. Got it. It's it's a tool for power workloads for power users. Yeah. Um and I think that's kind of where it fits. Nice. Yeah. Yeah. That that's that's the best way to say it, right? A tool for power workloads for power users. So again, just hitting on that theme of maximum control, maximum capability. This is why we focus so much on cloud code. And you know to be super clear you know ader is what that was in the previous generation we first had AI coding now we have agentic coding right AI coding is just writing code it's using prompts to generate code this is great you can do a lot here this sets up everything we're going to do on the channel moving forward make sure you're subscribed and then we now have agentic coding right any tool powerful model the right agent architecture this is the key idea this is what differentiates a low-level powerful agentic programmable tool like cloud code and then all the other tools, right? The cost thing is interesting. Do people pay internally or do you get free? If you work at Andra, you can just run this thing as much as you want every day. Um, it's for it's for free internally. Nice, man. Imagine that. I I think if everybody had it for free, it would be huge. Um, oh, that cost 20 cents. I can't believe I paid that much. How much do you think of that being your responsibility to try and make it more efficient versus that's not really what we're trying to do with the tool? We really see quad code as like the tool that gives you the smartest abilities out of the model. We do care about cost in so far as it's very correlated with latency and we want to make sure that this tool is extremely snappy to use and extremely thorough in its work. We want to be very intentional about all the tokens that it produces. I think we can do more to like communicate the cost with users. Um, currently we're seeing costs around like $6 per day per active user. And so it's wo wo $6 per day. I'll I'll pop up my previous week's uh cost on the screen. I'm doing way more than $6 per day. You know, I I probably am a power user of of Cloud Code. Comment down below. Let me know, you know, roughly what's your price price range. I recently did pick up the Claude Mac subscription which has been a, you know, massive dream to work with. Now I just pretty much prompt as much as I want to and uh I got to say so far it's been fantastic. I've hit zero rate limits although I know for certain I need to scale up my compute even further with this tool. I have a couple big ideas on how to do that. Some powerful agentic loops we're going to talk about on the channel. Make sure you're subscribed. But yeah, I just wanted to mention that I did make the jump. I now have the chat GPT Pro and the Cloud Max subscription so that I can scale my compute even further. I think these are probably the two most important subscriptions every engineer should have right now. Going cheap here is going to hurt you, but $6 a day. I mean, those are rookie numbers, right? It does come out to a bit higher um over the course of a month in cursor. Um but I don't think it's like out of band. The way I think about it is it's a ROI question. It's not a cost question. And so if you think about, you know, an average engineer salary, like engineers are very expensive. And if you can make an engineer 50 70% more productive, that's worth a lot. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So this is this is huge. I'm so glad they mentioned this. Um this is where a lot of engineers make a critical mistake. Your time is your most valuable resource. Let me say it one more time. Your time is your most valuable resource. Understanding what it's worth will pay you so much. You want to understand what your engineering time is worth and then pay to get more work done in less time. Right? If you can pay 50 bucks and get a $100 worth of engineering work done, you should press that button over and over and over. Okay? And you know, to be completely clear, this is why I picked up the cloud code subscription. It's why I have the chatbt pro subscription. It's all about getting access to premium compute and using it to get more work done than ever faster. Right? Speed is super super important. It doesn't matter if you do the task in a month. It matters if you can ship that work next week or in 3 days or tomorrow or in 2 hours. That's the big difference we're going to see between a lot of Genai engineers that really know how to wield their compute. We spend a lot of time on the channel talking about that, right? It's all about increasing your compute advantage. Use these tools together, get more done, wield compute like no one else. You want to be in that rare bunch on the end of the curve that can wield more compute in parallel with great tools like cloud code and codec. Speaking of codecs, um how are our tasks doing here? Let's let's see how we're doing. So create a new engineering plan. Let's go ahead and check this out. So this is that same prompt, right? I'm just saying, you know, come up with a new idea. Uh future enhancements. The goal is to showcase programmable agentic coding across multiple languages and workflows. Basically, it just wants to create new examples. I'm not going to think about this too much. I'm not going to use again too much of my time. We can just throw compute at this and see what happens. See what ideas we like. I think a big underutilized aspect of compute is just ideiation. Just, you know, let ideas flow. Try things. Experiment. See what the compute thinks about your work that you've done. Every once in a while, you know, one out of five, one out of eight prompts. It'll come up with something novel that'll actually help you in a way that you could not have imagined before. So, this looks great. Okay, I'm just going to say go ahead implement these ideas one and three cross language examples and automated testing. Let's go ahead and fire that off and let's just see what it comes up with. Right, we have compute at the ready. Why not use it? And we have a design new testing system. It looks like this is still in the works. We can view the log and we can see that this system is still running. Okay, so there we go. So we have an example here. Very interesting. Clawed testing v1. It looks like this is a module and then we have a test for this here. Nice. And it's a safe prompt. is going to first check for the clawed tool. So this is fantastic, right? So once again, if we like the changes that we see, we can go ahead hit push, create new PR, hit view, pull request. There is our new PR. Going to hit merge and get that in the codebase. So now, of course, I can open up cursor. We can pull, fast forward, and now we have these brand new two files ready to go in the codebase. So again, this is really great, right? We have compute working for me in the background. I'm not doing anything here. And you can imagine where this goes, right? We can scale this up to bigger, heavier-hitting features, which circles back to a big idea that we talk about inside of pack and on the channel. Great planning is great prompting. The way to scale up a powerful tool like Codeex and Cloud Code is to write more comprehensive plans that do more work for us, right? So instead of passing in, you know, a little randomized prompt here, we would look through our codebase, plan out an entire feature or plan with our AI coding tools, right? at our agent coding tools. We would AI plan draft and then drop that entire plan in here and have it build for us. But this is merge. Let's go ahead and archive. And this is fine. Let's go ahead and archive this as well. So, I got to say I'm a big fan of codeex. I like this tool so far. The question is, how far can we push it? We're going to be exploring that on the channel. Make sure you're subscribed. Let's go ahead and finish up key ideas from the cloud code creators. Paul from Ader always says how much of it was coded by Ader, you know. So then the question is how much of it was coded by cloud code? I wonder if you have a number like 50 pretty high. Probably near 80. Yeah, very high. Yeah. Yeah, 80% I think is a that's a great number. If you're still typing code manually, uh I think that's an absolute disaster. You need to you need to move into at least iteratively planning with AI coding tools. Focus on the ends of the process, right? The planning and the reviewing. Lots of reviewing. A lot of human code review though. Yeah, lot of lot of human code review. I think yeah yeah yeah that's that's that's perfect right lots of human code review for quad code internally in the GitHub repo we have this GitHub action that runs and the GitHub action invokes quad code with a local uh slash command and the slash command is lint so it just runs a llinter using quad and it's a bunch of things that are pretty tricky to do with a traditional llinter that's based on static analysis there's a bunch of these specific things that we check that are pretty difficult to express and in theory you can go in and you know write a bunch of lint rules for this honestly It's much easier to just write a one bullet in markdown in a local command and just commit that. Yeah. Yeah. So, so I mean Boris, this is huge. Boris has just literally spelled out the future of engineering in in its like really kind of first version, right? Linting documentation, writing tests. These are just the the the lowhanging fruit of the type of workflows you can build out, right? You can with cloud code, right? Again, with a programmable low-level terminal based tool like cloud code, you can now build out these powerful workflows, right? You can embed your coding agent and put it anywhere in your stack. In pack, we call these ADWs. They're more commonly just known as agentic workflows, but in the future, they'll just be called scripts. And we'll fully expect agent coding tools like cloud code to run uh these prompts inside of the scripts with really really high accuracy across our engineering stack. Right. This is a big idea. More on this in the future. I think the llinter part that you mentioned I think maybe people skipped it over. It doesn't register the first time but like going from like rulebased linting to like semantic linting I think is like great and super important. And I think a lot of companies are trying to do how do you do autonomous PR review. I'm curious how you think about closing the loop or making that better. Wow. Close the loop. Really, really powerful idea. Close the loop. Uh, you know, let the code write itself. Pack members. You're very familiar with these ideas and figuring out especially like what are you supposed to review? You know, it's like, am I really supposed to read all of this? It kind of seems most of it seems pretty standard. Yeah, I know it's a very open-ended question, but any thoughts you have would be great. Yeah, we we have some experiments where Quad is doing code review internally. We're not super happy with the results yet. So, it's not something that we want to open up quite yet. The way we're thinking about it is cloud code is, like I said before, it's a primitive. So, if you want to use it to build a code review tool, you can do this. If you want to, you know, build like a security scanning vulnerability scanning tool, you can do that. If you want to build a semantic llinter, you can do that. And hopefully with code, it makes it so if you want to do this, it's just a few lines of code. Yeah. So, this is incredible. And and again, that really hits on this the key idea, right? Cloud code is a primitive. It gives you full control. You can build whatever you want. And as engineers, it's important to gravitate toward, you know, an array of tools so that you can reach for the right tool for the job. And the general move for engineers is just to use the tool they're most familiar with or the most popular tool or tools that are just easy to use. But you always want to have that granular tool in the age that you're in. We are in the generative AI age. The most granular, performant, programmable tool for us right now is clawed code. At the same time, you do want to have, you know, your powerful codecs, your Devon, your, you know, replet v0ero, whatever. You want to have that in the bag as well. But it's really important to distinguish that, right? That's that's the tool for the agentic era. For the, you know, AI coding era, you know, Ader was that low-level uh tool. But I just want to give you a you know concrete framework of how you can think about how you can maximize your compute at the right level with all these tools available to you. Cloud code is a primitive. Even if we use cloud code to write a lot of our code, it's still up to the individual who merges it to be responsible for like this being well-maintained, well doumented code that has like reasonable abstractions. And so I I think that's something that will continue to happen where cloud code isn't its own engineer that's like committing code by itself. It's still very much up to the IC's to be responsible for the code. Yeah. Yeah. This this is really important. I've never believed that narrative that AI is replacing engineers. Um even when you get to powerful agent coding tools like codeex uh Devon lovable what whatever the tool is it never replaces the engineer because someone is still reviewing that final output that final you know block of code just as you saw here right as you write your task you need to review them you need to see that there it's doing what you want the the big advantage now is that we can automate a lot of this process right we can hand off a lot of this to compute but you still need to validate You still need to plan and review. You still need to apply your taste and judgment to what's going on and what's the best way to have taste and judgment. You've built tools yourself. You analyze the inputs and outputs yourself. Right? It doesn't matter how great or how agentic whatever the tooling gives us. You still need to at some point enter a review process. Right? AI is not replacing engineers. engineers using AI are going to replace the nonAI engineer. As it gets easier to build stuff, it changes the way that I write software where like like cat saying like before I would write a big design doc and I would think about a problem for a long time before I would build it sometimes for some set of problems. And now I'll just ask quad code to prototype like three versions of it and I'll try the feature and see which one I like better. And then that informs me much better and much faster than a doc would have. Very interesting. So this is something that I have been playing with a little bit more. I think that there's a line between, you know, which one you choose with these powerful agent coding tools. Do you go the rapid prototype route where you create multiple versions or do you, you know, go into design doc world AI plan draft, right? Build with your AI, plan with your AI, but you first, you know, spec everything out. I think you want to be doing a little bit of both depending on the situation. Um, I think the doc PRD or spec first approach is still optimal right now. So I'm going to be comparing and contrasting the multiversion rapid prototype approach versus the spec first approach. I'll definitely share my findings on the channel. So for example, something I'll do sometimes is if I have a planning question or a research type question, I'll ask bud to investigate a few paths in parallel. And you can do this today if you just ask it. So say you know I want to refactor X to do Y. Can you research three separate ideas for how to do it? Do it in parallel. Use three agents to do it. Yeah. So, so, so this hints on a really powerful idea, right? I mean, you can quite literally see this inside of codecs, right? We use this idea in codec, right? It's parallelism. Um, with compute, with these machines, with the right technique, you can do multiple things at the same time. In fact, as mentioned, this is a capability built directly into cloud code. Right? This is what Boris is talking about. You can batch and you can run tasks, right? So, you can create sub agents and you can run multiple tools in parallel. Just real quick, I know this video is getting long, but you know, you can do this very quickly, right? We have cloud code is programmable. You can do something like this, right? Read all py files in parallel. Even at the micro level, right? You can use parallelism to speed up your work very quickly. So watch this. Cloud code is going to return some tokens here and these tokens are going to enable there it is parallel reads. Okay, so very cool. We can do the same thing here. write a oneline summary at the top of each of those files in parallel. So after the permission check, this will kick off a parallel write of a summary to each one of these files. There's the first right update. But if we scroll up here, you can see we have that call sub aent parallel task call. And then we have this multiple update happening. Now something really cool is going to happen. Once I hit shift tab, all these changes are going to roll in at the same time. Okay, so bam. Look at that. Right, right, right, right, right, right, right. All in parallel, right? These are nonsequential tasks. You can see with our prompt, right, with that IDK, right, that specific keyword, we're able to kick off a parallel read on the micro level, right? Where we're fully in control of our agentic coding tool, cloud code. And on a more macro level, we saw that in codeex as well, right? So, you really want to be thinking about how you can parallelize your tasks. We can apply these old very consistent ideas of engineering, right? parallelism. When you don't have blocking tasks, just apply parallelism to get more things done at the same time. And this is something that you really want to think about, right? If your tasks are non-blocking, try just throwing this keyword inside of your claw code prompt. Okay? Just parallelize it. Yeah. Like context, for example, is a big one where like a lot of times if you have a very long conversation and you compact a few times, maybe some of your original intent isn't as strongly present as it was when you first started. And so maybe the model like forgets some of what you originally told it to do. And so we're really excited about things like larger effective context windows so that you can have these like gnarly like really long hundreds of thousands of tokens long tasks and make sure that cloud code is on track the whole way through. This is huge, right? This happens to me all the time. I'm sure it happens to you if you're using cloud code, right? You always have to compact at some point. You know, they have this great autocompact feature, but compact, just like rag, always suffers from information loss. It's a band-aid, a decent one, but a band-aid for a problem that can only truly be solved by longer context. I think, you know, Anthropic realizes this. I think other orgs realize this. We can see this in some of the larger, you know, context window um language models. Right now, sonnet stuck at 200k. I'm predicting that Anthropic puts out a new 500kish token context window model, Claude 4, Sonnet, and hopefully Claude for Opus. But we'll see, right? What we really need to do is get this larger keyword that Cat said there, effective context token window increased. Right? A lot of the current state 1 million context models, they're not really 1 million contexts, right? They lose track somewhere in the middle here. That's what we really want to see. And I think we're definitely going to get this this year. in 2025. Um, and it's going to be a huge lift for tools like cloud code. What do all these powerful atentic tools mean on both ends of the spectrum? So, a couple things here. You can scale your compute even further. You want to be thinking about having compute working for you all the time, right? As much as possible. Background tasks, parallel tasks, local terminal tasks running. You want an app in every one of these categories that you can quickly jump into and get engineering work done. Ideally, you're always running something. something's always getting completed for you in the background. Okay, this is a big theme on the channel. We're going to be exploring. This is our northstar. Build a living software that works for us while we sleep. All these tools also mean that engineering velocity is going up. If you want to keep up, you have to scale your compute to scale your impact. You want to make sure that you have a low-level fully controllable terminal-based tool. And you really want to understand the terminal, right? This is the highest leverage point for engineering work. On the other end, you want to have a tool that's easy to use that you can quickly just spin up, fix bugs, fix issues, build out small to medium-sized tasks with a single prompt. We know that great planning is great prompting. And if you can write a great prompt or a plan, you can get a lot of engineering work done. Have your web app ready. And then in the middle, we basically all already have some type of desktop app, some, you know, cursor, VS Code, wind surf, zed, whatever you want to use. You know, this one is less of an issue, but I think that you do want to have a highly controllable programmable tool where you can build up powerful agentic workflows at the ready in your tool belt. And you want to have a powerful web app that operates fully in the cloud where you can hand off a lot of work. You want to have your environments all configured. We're going to be using codecs. We're going to be pushing it to see how far we can really take it on the channel. Make sure you're subscribed. The big theme here is the same. We've been talking about it week after week after week. To scale your success as an engineer, scale your compute. I'm going to leave the link in the description to this full podcast. Check it out. This was a fantastic interview. I didn't have enough time here to cover a lot of the other key points, but I wanted to quickly give you the five most important ones. Check out this podcast link in the description. And no matter what, stay focused and keep building.
