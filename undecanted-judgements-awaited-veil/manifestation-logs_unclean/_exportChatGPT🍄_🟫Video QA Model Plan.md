## Prompt:
Help the user come up with a plan we want to come up with a way to create a model that can watch videos and answer Q and a about it and understand it. Basically here we want to do that but we're going to have it breakdown into smaller steps so it watches smaller portions of the video in theory that should retain more context and be more detailed about the videos it's going to be watching so whether that means getting the transcript and matching that up to the video however whatever is the best way to do this I haven't researched it so you will have to see what else other people are doing and then we'll go from there let's see what you come up with.

## Prompt:
Let's just focus on an MVP we want functionality over esthetics so let's do all the back end logic get it to actually function before we really dive into any kind of front end type work and then we'll add it in

## Response:
Great — focusing on backend logic first is the right move for an MVP like this. Here's a streamlined, backend-first plan to get your system up and running:

* * *

### 🔧 **MVP Plan: Video Q&A System Backend**

#### 1\. **Input Handling: Video Upload or Link**

*   **Tools**: `youtube-dl` or `pytube` for YouTube videos; `moviepy` or `ffmpeg` for local files.
    
*   **Goal**: Extract audio and keyframes from the video for processing.
    

#### 2\. **Speech-to-Text (Transcript Generation)**

*   **Tool**: OpenAI Whisper (best trade-off between speed, accuracy, and simplicity).
    
*   **Output**: Timestamped transcript (.srt or .json format).
    

#### 3\. **Chunk the Transcript**

*   **Method**: Break transcript into overlapping windows (e.g., 30s chunks with 10s overlap).
    
*   **Why**: Keeps context intact and makes downstream Q&A more relevant.
    

#### 4\. **Embed the Chunks**

*   **Tool**: Use `OpenAI Embeddings`, `HuggingFace Transformers` (e.g., `all-MiniLM`), or `LangChain`.
    
*   **Store**: In-memory (for MVP), or lightweight vector store like `FAISS`.
    

#### 5\. **Question Answering Engine**

*   **Process**:
    
    1.  Take user’s question.
        
    2.  Convert it to an embedding.
        
    3.  Find top-N most relevant chunks using cosine similarity.
        
    4.  Feed selected context and question into an LLM (e.g., GPT-4 or Mistral).
        
*   **Output**: Return the answer with optional confidence scoring.
    

#### 6\. **Optional (for better UX): Segment-to-Video Mapping**

*   **Use**: Whisper timestamps to align answers with the original video timeline.
    
*   **Purpose**: Allows future linking back to “when” something was said or shown.
    

* * *

### 🔗 Connection to LM Studio Open WebUI API

Assume LM Studio is hosted locally with Open WebUI listening on:

```http
POST http://localhost:11434/api/generate
Content-Type: application/json
```

### 🧠 Specialized Prompt Template for Video Q&A

```jinja
{{system}}
You are a precise assistant that answers questions using provided transcript excerpts from a video.

Context:
{{retrieved_chunks}}

User Question:
{{user_question}}

Answer clearly and concisely using only the provided context.
```

**System prompt** (set once in LM Studio's custom instruction):

> You only answer based on the transcript context given. Do not hallucinate. If the answer isn’t clear in the transcript, say so.

* * *

🔧 4. Backend API Design (FastAPI Example)
------------------------------------------

### `/upload-video`

```http
POST /upload-video
Body: mp4 or YouTube link
→ Extract audio → Transcribe → Chunk → Embed → Store
Returns: `video_id`
```

### `/ask-question`

```http
GET /ask-question?video_id=abc123&q=“What did the speaker say about climate policy?”
→ Retrieve top-N chunks via vector search
→ Format prompt
→ Send to LM Studio API
→ Return: Answer + Transcript Snippet + Timestamp
```

* * *

🧹 5. Backend Directory Structure
---------------------------------

```
