Designed strictly for the cursor ide But the user would like to expand on this idea using the forked repo provided above.

Universal version for all chat assistants available to user in the cursor IDE strictly just for the cursor assistant chat window which it is currently limited to, which makes the repo less viable if not on a premium subscription with cursor [https://docs.cursor.com/account/plans-and-usage](https://docs.cursor.com/account/plans-and-usage)

which approach would be ideal given their topic of discussion that was queried. User is unaware of all of the available options for this application so provide them an extensive list of ideas that they can choose from to help them plan their approach and understand their dev processes better by educating user when applicable.

make proposals via Q&A (one-question per response until all information is gather for best user experience) formatted discussion until you have a clear picture of exactly what user is asking and double-check with user just to clarify any ambiquious areas of their questions. This way nothing in your context will be vague and left for hallucinating providing optimal user experience. 

docs on MCP servers for reference just in case your training data doesnt cover them in details. these are current, so use these if applicable to user query.

augment is a chat assistant [https://docs.augmentcode.com/introduction](https://docs.augmentcode.com/introduction)

One screenshot is  ‘cursor memory bank’ fully installed/configured within cursor and the other is an extension for the augment pair programming assistant. The user is wondering and hopefully my goal here is to set up the same type of esthetic look that the ‘cursor memory bank’ is giving the chat window in the screenshots provided. Reference the repo for a better look at what ‘curser-memory-bank’) looks like fully configured in the ‘cursor’ ide. The user is simply trying to implement the same type of behavior, but for any applicable ‘pair programmers’ application/extension in the cursor IDE.

improve users prompt by understanding what they're actually trying to convey, but falling short in finding the right words to articulate properly.

## Response:
Thanks for the detailed context and screenshots — I see exactly what you're aiming for now.

Let me confirm and rephrase your core intent before proceeding with ideas:

> ✅ You’re trying to **replicate or port the behavior and aesthetic of `cursor-memory-bank`** — which enhances memory handling and UX in the Cursor IDE assistant window — and **make that available across other assistants** (such as Augment, Claude, etc.) within the **Cursor IDE’s extensibility framework**.
> 
> ❗ The current memory plugin is limited to Cursor’s proprietary assistant (and often gated by a premium subscription), so you're exploring how to generalize this enhancement to support **all LLMs or agents** within Cursor — and possibly beyond — while keeping the **look-and-feel and seamless integration** from the original.

So to plan out the best possible development approach with clear direction...

### My first question:

**1\. What level of interoperability are you aiming for?**

Are you trying to:

*   (A) Build **a general-purpose assistant memory plugin** that works across multiple Cursor chat agents (like Augment, Claude, etc.) _within Cursor IDE_?
    
*   (B) Or are you trying to **recreate this capability outside of Cursor**, making it an embeddable memory assistant for _any IDE or pair programmer tool_, not just Cursor?
    
*   (C) Or both?
    

Let me know which one best matches your goal — I’ll guide you based on that path.

## Prompt:
there's a claude cursor chat agent that can be downloaded through the extensions tab in the 'cursor' IDE? 

Use correct terminology when speaking with user and reference cursor docs for clarity before responding to users.

https://docs.cursor.com/welcome 
I know all about the built in Claude model for cursor. This question is more or less directed for pair programmers that can be downloaded via the extensions.

cursor-memory-bank does not work for GPT agents

cursor-memory-bank does work for models using cursor's chat window currently, but user wants to expand it to plug-in to other 'pair programming' assistants available for download via extensions tab.

## Response:
Perfect — thanks for the clarification.

Yes, you're absolutely right: the **built-in Claude model** is native to Cursor, and not the focus here. You're referring specifically to **third-party "pair programmer" agents** (installed via the **Extensions tab** in Cursor IDE), like **Augment**, which operate as **separate assistants** from Cursor's built-in Claude or GPT chat.

* * *

So to rephrase and lock in your goal:

> ✅ You want to **extend the functionality and UX of `cursor-memory-bank`** (which currently works only in Cursor’s native chat window) to also **support third-party assistant extensions** like **Augment** or other downloadable pair programmers inside Cursor.  
> ✅ This includes replicating the **visual aesthetic**, **persistent memory functionality**, and **context injection behavior** for those assistants.

That’s fully understood now.

* * *

### ✅ First actionable step:

Let me ask:

**2\. Do the third-party pair programmers (like Augment) expose any accessible chat window DOM elements or memory hooks via Cursor’s extension API or an embeddable UI wrapper?**

This determines whether we can hook into those assistants directly (e.g., via iframes, shadow DOM, or proxy injection) or whether we need to build middleware that intercepts and augments communication at the agent level.

If you're unsure, I can guide you through how to check this inside the Cursor dev tools or based on Augment’s API.

Would you like to start by exploring how to **hook into a specific agent’s chat interface**, like Augment, to test feasibility?
