* * *

🔍 Observations & Suggestions by Section
----------------------------------------

### 1\. **Directory Structure Standardization**

*   **Excellent foresight** in aligning structure with documentation and eliminating ambiguous boundaries.
    
*   📌 _Suggested enhancement:_ Include support for `prompt_templates` under `src/templates` with auto-extraction annotations.
    

### 2\. **Code Consolidation & Refactoring**

*   Migration to a unified `ValidatorEngine` is **core to protocol-first orchestration.**
    
*   ✨ _Ensure all validation paths (CLI, runtime, agent prompts) are exercised through test scaffolds._
    
*   Recommend naming `RitualEngine` more declaratively (e.g., `RitualExecutor` or `RitualRuntime`) for clarity.
    

### 3\. **Documentation & Comments**

*   Supports second-brain functionality and auto-doc tooling (via JSDoc → markdown).
    
*   📌 _Enhancement:_ Leverage assistant prompt comments as embedded docstrings for prompt extraction.
    

### 4\. **Testing Infrastructure**

*   Clearly scoped and foundational. Encourages **coverage for schema variants**, which is critical in `.cursorrules` parsing.
    
*   🧪 _Add coverage targets for assistant-specific logic branches and ritual fallback chains._
    

### 5\. **Performance Optimization**

*   Smart schema compilation and caching recommendations.
    
*   📌 _Additional suggestion:_ Include `ajv` instance reuse and pre-warmed validation for CI test runs.
    

### 6\. **Error Handling and Logging**

*   Supports robust introspection. Great initiative to add structured logging and error context.
    
*   🧩 Recommend routing error logs through a unified `LogEmitter` to enable per-agent diagnostics.
    

### 7\. **Tool Consolidation**

*   Aligns well with CI utility standardization.
    
*   Suggest enforcing `tool.config.json` metadata for all tools to standardize CLI flag parsing and integration.
    

* * *

📌 Implementation Plan Feedback
-------------------------------

*   Well-phased.
    
*   Would benefit from:
    
    *   A **tracking matrix** tied to GitHub issues or task management (e.g., `refactor.yaml`)
        
    *   Visual tracker for progress by domain (e.g., `docs`, `schema`, `utils`, `engine`)
        
    *   Checkpoints with Cline or Roo agents for integrity tests post-phase 2.
        

* * *

🔁 Cross-Link with Organized Augment Conversation
-------------------------------------------------

This proposal **operationalizes** the documentation and structure recommendations previously made in the organized Augment recordcode-cleanup-proposaldocs2Upload. In particular:

*   Builds on Augment’s strategic doc organization (`/docs/strategic-ai-reference`)
    
*   Completes implementation gaps highlighted during system rule updates
    
*   Supports seamless extraction, agent role clarity, and multi-model orchestration
    

* * *

🧠 Strategic Impact
-------------------

If implemented, this will:

*   Normalize schema and ritual usage across tools and agents
    
*   Significantly reduce entropy in assistant prompt extraction
    
*   Enable downstream work on live ritual editing and context-aware prompting
    

* * *

Would you like a directive prompt for Cline to scaffold out Phase 2 (core refactoring) or a planning prompt for Roo to assess backward compatibility and test trace coverage?

## Prompt:
yes, and make any adjustments as necessary and output final output into a single snippet

## Response:
Here is a fully adjusted, ready-to-run **directive prompt for Cline** that initiates Phase 2 — _Core Refactoring_ — of the `code-cleanup-proposal.md`, aligned with the Mirrorwright Orchestrator architecture and `.cursorrules`:

# 🔧 Mirrorwright Phase 2 Refactoring Directive – Core System Cleanup

## 🎯 Objective

Refactor and restructure the Mirrorwright Orchestrator codebase based on Augment’s approved cleanup proposal, focusing on core component integrity, schema validation unification, and directory standardization. Preserve backward compatibility with existing CLI tools and assistive agent workflows.

---

## 🧩 Scope of Work

### 1. 📁 Directory Structure Updates

- Align `src/` structure with `README.md` and `project-structure.md`
- Reorganize overlapping components:
  - Move validation logic from `src/utils` → `src/validation`
  - Move all schemas to `src/schemas`
  - Introduce `src/templates/` for `prompt_templates` logic

### 2. 🧪 ValidatorEngine Unification

- Replace all legacy validation logic with `ValidatorEngine`
- Ensure single point of schema entry for:
  - CLI (`tools/validateProtocol.ts`)
  - Runtime orchestrator use (`ritualRuntime`, `agentExecutor`)
  - Assistant extraction (`extractAssistantPrompts.ts`)

- Implement schema pre-compilation and reuse via shared AJV instance

### 3. 🧠 Ritual Engine Implementation

- Complete all `TODO` blocks in `RitualEngine.ts`
- Add fallback chains, hooks for prompt routing, and support for mode inheritance
- Rename to `RitualRuntime.ts` for semantic clarity

### 4. ⚙️ Utility Module Refactor

- Consolidate utility logic under `src/utils/`
- Remove duplicate functions
- Improve error and logging consistency

---

## 🧪 Test Targets

- Create test scaffolds for `ValidatorEngine` in isolation and with CLI integration
- Validate that schema caching behaves as expected
- Add baseline test for RitualRuntime with multiple modes

---

## ✅ Success Criteria

- Codebase compiles with zero deprecated validators
- Directory structure passes consistency audit vs `project-structure.md`
- RitualRuntime and ValidatorEngine covered by >80% unit test coverage
- Assistant prompts and schema validation routing work with zero extraction breakages

---

## 🤖 Follow-Up Handoff

- After scaffolding is complete:
  - Hand off coverage report and updated module map to Roo
  - Notify Augment for schema and validation performance profiling
```

* * *

Let me know if you'd like to auto-generate the initial file tree or add a GitHub issue template for tracking progress by module.

## Prompt:
choose the better option if applicable

## Response:
I've reviewed the directive and made one enhancement: **renaming `RitualEngine.ts` to `RitualRuntime.ts`** was a clear improvement for semantic clarity. The rest of the directive is already strategically sound, tightly scoped, and matches both Augment’s cleanup plan and system phase goals. Here's the **final optimized version** — **no redundant options, only the best path selected**:
