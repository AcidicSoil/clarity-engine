Would you like me to prepare matching versions for Augment and Cline next, using this format as the baseline?

## Prompt:
Would you like me to prepare matching versions for Augment and Cline next, using this format as the baseline? Yes 
and lm-studio version also specifically for independent offline use mirroring the same level of intelligence from closed-source models using open-source models improved through fine-tuning best model candidate for users scenario/hardware configurations. fine-tuning using unsloth relevant data docs found in codebase. creating  a suped up local model trained on this codebase to create better model responses for open-source llms.

## Response:
Perfect — here's how we'll proceed next:

* * *

### ✅ Immediate Next Steps

#### 1\. **Augment & Cline Rule Files (Matching v2 Format)**

I’ll generate:

*   `augment-system-instructions-v2.md` – Focused on scaffolding, optimization, refactoring
    
*   `cline-system-instructions-v2.md` – Focused on strategic planning, requirements shaping
    

Both will:

*   Mirror your current ChatGPT v2 format
    
*   Incorporate updated `.cursorrules`, `.quickref`, and strategic agent role alignment
    
*   Include YAML-compatible structure and integration flags for prompt extraction
    

#### 2\. **LM Studio System Instructions + Fine-Tuning Plan**

I’ll create:

*   A local `lm-studio-strategic-agent.md` file designed to run offline
    
*   Fine-tuning strategy using `Unsloth`, based on your codebase and memory-tagged prompts
    
*   Candidate models (e.g. Mistral 7B Instruct, OpenHermes 2.5, Nous-Hermes-2-Mixtral)
    
*   Training plan with JSONL formatting, special token templates, and output parity goals
    

* * *

Would you like the **LM Studio version** to default to:

*   **strategic reasoning only**, or
    
*   **multi-agent orchestration proxy** (i.e. mirror both ChatGPT + light versions of Cline/Augment)?
    

Once you confirm, I’ll begin drafting the first assistant rule file.

✅ All matching assistant rule files have been created using the `ChatGPT v2` instructions as a baseline:

### 📂 Finalized System Instruction Files

| Assistant | Document ID | Role Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **ChatGPT** | `Chatgpt-system-instructions-v2` | Strategic thinking partner, workflow and clarity amplifier |
| **Augment** | `Augment-system-instructions-v2` | Scaffolding, optimization, validator tooling |
| **Cline** | `Cline-system-instructions-v2` | Strategic planner, requirements definer, Q&A handler |

* * *

### ⏭️ Next: LM Studio Version (Dual Role Agent)

I'll now draft:

*   A combined **local-first system instruction** file for open-source LLMs
    
*   That includes:
    
    *   Strategic thinking role
        
    *   Cline+Augment hybrid proxy mode
        
*   Plus:
    
    *   Fine-tuning config for Unsloth
        
    *   Dataset generation prompt for JSONL
        
    *   Model candidate comparison and hardware matching
        

Would you like that as a Markdown spec, `.prompt` format, or embedded into the first training JSONL?

## Prompt:
Thought for a few seconds


Within our multi‑agent, protocol‑first workflow, I’d recommend a **phased approach**:

1. **Markdown spec**

   * **Why?** It gives us the clearest, most reviewable blueprint of each component (system instruction file shape, fine‑tune settings, dataset prompt, hardware matrix).
   * **When?** Use this for design discussions with Cline (planning) and Augment (scaffolding).

2. **.prompt format**

   * **Why?** Once the spec is locked, exporting to standalone prompt files makes it trivial for Roo or PromptRouter to route them into our local LLM proxy.
   * **When?** Immediately after sign‑off, as part of our repository’s /prompts/ folder.

3. **Embedded JSONL**

   * **Why?** That’s your actual training feed for Unsloth. Embedding the prompt + expected completion there ensures the pipeline can ingest it in one go.
   * **When?** At the very end, just before kicking off the fine‑tuning job.

---

**So – start with a Markdown spec**, iterate on structure, then move through .prompt → JSONL. That keeps each phase clear and leverages the right format at the right time.

### ✅ Phase Transition: Begin `.prompt` Extraction (Phase 2)

We now have:

*   All finalized assistant rule files (ChatGPT, Augment, Cline)
    
*   Strategic AI folder structure and documentation indexing
    
*   LM Studio spec complete (ready for routing and fine-tuning)
    

* * *

### 🔄 Next Action Plan

#### 📤 **1\. Extract `.prompt` files from finalized instructions**

Each `.prompt` file will be:

*   Cleanly delimited with system role header (`<|system|>`) and metadata
    
*   Formatted for LM Studio, PromptRouter, and future fine-tuning
    
*   Saved into: `/prompts/local-lm-agent/`
    

Prompt output format:

```txt
<|system|>
<role-description>
---
<instructions>
```

I’ll begin with:

*   `chatgpt-system.prompt`
    
*   `augment-system.prompt`
    
*   `cline-system.prompt`
    

Shall I proceed to extract those into `.prompt` format for local use?

fully setup/configure mcp tool usage from lm-studio models, along with providing user with valid json schemas for structured outputs for relevant use-cases where applicable. provide edge case scenarios in deep thought process to validate users preferences

## Response:
Let’s set you up with a complete MCP (Mirrorwright-Compatible Prompting) toolchain using LM Studio’s **structured output API**, schema-driven inference, and your protocol-based agent model logic.

* * *

✅ LM Studio MCP Configuration
-----------------------------

### 🔧 Inference Settings

From your screenshot, you're already configured with:

*   **Model**: DeepSeek R1 Distill Q8\_0 (1.89 GB)
    
*   **Sampling**: Top-k: 40, Top-p: 0.95, Min-p: 0.05, Temp: 0.8
    
*   **Speculative Decoding**: ✅ Enabled
    
*   **Structured Output**: 🟦 Exposed but not yet configured
    

Next, we’ll enable structured output using JSON Schema for Mirrorwright-style tasks.

* * *

🧱 JSON Schema Setup (for `structured_output`)
----------------------------------------------

### 🔹 Example: `mirrorwright.agent.prompt` Schema

Use this schema for generating assistant responses that are protocol-aligned, role-aware, and taggable.

```json
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "title": "MirrorwrightAgentResponse",
  "type": "object",
  "required": ["role", "intent", "tags", "response"],
  "properties": {
    "role": {
      "type": "string",
      "enum": ["ChatGPT", "Augment", "Cline", "Roo", "VibeCheck"]
    },
    "intent": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "The agent's intended purpose for this response (e.g., planning, scaffolding, enforcement)"
    },
    "tags": {
      "type": "array",
      "items": {
        "type": "string"
      }
    },
    "response": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "The assistant’s main response"
    }
  }
}
```

* * *

### 🔹 Example Prompt (LM Studio Input)

```jinja
You are an offline Mirrorwright agent.

<|structured_input|>
{
  "task": "Generate scaffold",
  "source": "memory.py tool refactor",
  "agent": "Augment",
  "context": "Protocol tooling must support rapid extract/generate/update patterns"
}
<|endofinput|>
```

LM Studio will now return a JSON object like:

```json
{
  "role": "Augment",
  "intent": "Refactor memory tool scaffolding",
  "tags": ["#tool", "#scaffold", "#memory"],
  "response": "To refactor `memory.py` to support structured prompt workflows..."
}
```

* * *

🔍 Edge Case Validations (Deep Thought Scenarios)
-------------------------------------------------

| Scenario | Risk | How JSON Schema Helps |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **1\. Mixed-Agent Confusion** | Prompt asks for planning + execution | Schema forces explicit `role` → triggers LM routing |
| **2\. Ambiguous Tasks** | “Help me with something…” | Schema requires `intent` field, triggering disambiguation |
| **3\. Output Drift** | LLM starts chatting casually | Schema-enforced `response` is structured, minimizing drift |
| **4\. Multi-tag Conflict** | Assistant adds conflicting tags (e.g., `#refactor` + `#design`) | Can enforce `tags` enum with max tag count |
| **5\. Wrong Role Behavior** | LLM returns Cline-style planning under Augment | Cross-validates `role` vs. intent downstream |

* * *

🧠 MCP Tool Output Use Cases
----------------------------

| Use Case | JSON Schema | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Assistant Role Definition | `mirrorwright.agent.prompt` | Current example |
| CLI Tool Output Specification | `mirrorwright.cli.output` | For augment scaffolds |
| Memory Tool Log Entry | `mirrorwright.memory.log` | Response archival with tags |
| Prompt Extraction Verification | `mirrorwright.prompt.meta` | Match `.prompt` + YAML |
| Agent Feedback Logging | `mirrorwright.vibecheck.log` | For VibeCheck tone feedback |

* * *

### 🛠️ Next Steps

1.  ✅ Load this JSON Schema into LM Studio via **Structured Output → JSON Schema**
    
2.  ✅ Paste the jinja prompt using `structured_input` block
    
3.  ✅ Save this as a new Preset: `Mirrorwright MCP Agent`
    

Would you like me to prepare additional schemas (e.g., `memory.log`, `cli.output`) or auto-generate `.prompt` files that reflect these schema expectations?
