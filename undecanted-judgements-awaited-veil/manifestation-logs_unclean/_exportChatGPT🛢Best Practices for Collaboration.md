## Prompt:
What's the best way to work with you

## Response:
Great question. To get the best results from me‚Äîespecially for designing expert-level system prompts or AI agents‚Äîhere‚Äôs how to work with me effectively:

* * *

### ‚úÖ **How to Work with Me Best**

1.  **Tell Me What You're Building**
    
    *   What kind of GPT or AI agent are you creating?
        
    *   What's the **role** or **domain** expertise it should have?
        
2.  **Describe the Desired Output**
    
    *   What kind of responses should the AI produce?
        
    *   Should they be long, structured, evaluative, creative, etc.?
        
3.  **Specify the Use Case or Task Type**
    
    *   Is this for writing, summarizing, coding, analysis, decision support, etc.?
        
4.  **Indicate the Model Size**
    
    *   Will this run on a small (1B‚Äì7B), medium (13B), or large (175B+) model?
        
    *   This helps tailor prompt complexity and CoT depth.
        

* * *

### üî• Bonus Tips

*   **Be Specific**: The more clearly you define the expert role and task, the better the prompt will perform.
    
*   **Iterate Together**: I can revise prompts based on your feedback‚Äîtreat this like a collaboration.
    
*   **Ask for Examples**: If you‚Äôre unsure, I can generate demo prompts or templates you can customize.
    

* * *

Would you like to describe the GPT or agent you're trying to build so we can start crafting a perfect system prompt?

## Prompt:
I'm not sure about that zero. way we can narrow down. until we figure that part out.

## Response:
Absolutely‚Äîwe can narrow it down together. Let‚Äôs find clarity by exploring some core options. I‚Äôll ask **just four key questions** to triangulate what kind of GPT or AI agent you‚Äôre trying to build:

* * *

### üîç Narrowing Down: Help Me Help You

1.  **What‚Äôs the general purpose of the agent?**  
    _(e.g., writing assistant, research analyst, code generator, business strategist, product ideator, creative storyteller, tutor, etc.)_
    
2.  **Who is the end-user or target audience?**  
    _(e.g., startup founders, marketers, students, developers, executives, designers, etc.)_
    
3.  **What kind of output should it produce?**  
    _(e.g., strategic plans, technical explanations, pitch decks, lesson plans, UI copy, summaries, etc.)_
    
4.  **What tone or style do you prefer?**  
    _(e.g., expert and concise, friendly and casual, formal and academic, bold and creative?)_
    

* * *

Once you answer these, I can show you 1‚Äì2 tailored system prompt examples to choose from or refine. Want to start with question 1?

## Prompt:
How about an idea critiquer? one that criticizes the user's ideas fostering other outputs by critiquing users Original idea enforcing them to navigate other directions and approaches

## Response:
Perfect‚Äîthat's a strong direction.

You're describing a GPT that acts as an **idea critic**, helping users **refine, redirect, or rethink** their original concepts by offering **constructive criticism** and **pushing them into new creative or strategic territory**.

Let‚Äôs refine this with the remaining 3 questions:

* * *

### üß† So far we have:

> **Agent Role:** Idea Critiquer ‚Äì challenges and critiques the user's idea to drive better alternatives.

* * *

### To lock it in, can you answer these?

2.  **Who will use this GPT?**
    
    *   Entrepreneurs? Designers? Writers? Students? Product managers? Creatives?
        
3.  **What type of ideas will users bring?**
    
    *   Business startups? App ideas? Stories? Marketing campaigns? Philosophical ideas?
        
4.  **What tone should the critique have?**
    
    *   Tough-love directness? Polite academic tone? Sarcastic like a roast? Friendly but firm?
        

* * *

Once I have those, I‚Äôll generate a **high-performance system prompt** in markdown format that builds this GPT into an elite-level ‚Äúconstructive idea demolisher.‚Äù Ready?

## Prompt:
Well we can start by having you pretend to be that idea critiquer as we design the actual idea into fruition.

## Response:
Love that. Let‚Äôs do it‚ÄîI'll **step into the role of the idea critiquer agent** while simultaneously helping you **design and refine the system prompt** for this GPT.

* * *

### üß† My Temporary Role: _The Idea Critiquer_

> I challenge, deconstruct, and critique your ideas‚Äînot to shoot them down, but to **provoke stronger, sharper, and more original thinking**. My goal is to **push your creativity past the obvious**.

Let‚Äôs begin. Please drop an idea‚Äîany idea. I‚Äôll respond with:

*   A **brutal-but-constructive critique**
    
*   A **reframed direction or variation**
    
*   Optional: A **"What if you tried‚Ä¶" nudge**
    

Once we‚Äôve done a few, I‚Äôll distill this dynamic into a formal, exportable **system prompt** you can plug into a custom GPT.

What‚Äôs your first idea?

## Prompt:
Well at the moment I'm working on (placeholder) hmmm.... im not really even sure hence the reason for this conversation. i could share a bit of a conversation but i dont want you to take it too literal because the idea is that my idea needs to be "shaken down to the core" dispelling weakness from it until i figure out what i truly am trying to create. so i guess a level of curious uncertainty from the assistant that doesnt narrow its scope until it can say with 100% confidence "this is what the user exactly wants"

## Response:
üî• Got it‚Äîand that's a **brilliant use case**.

You're not just creating an idea critiquer‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre creating an **idea excavator**‚Äîa GPT that doesn‚Äôt just react to user ideas but **actively destabilizes and interrogates them** to reveal their **core truth or most viable path**.

Let me reflect what you‚Äôre building:

* * *

### üß¨ Agent Concept: ‚ÄúThe Idea Excavator‚Äù

> A GPT that engages in open-ended exploration, challenging and critiquing early, undeveloped, or ambiguous ideas‚Äînot to kill them, but to **dispel illusions, uncover blind spots, and surface the most authentic, high-potential direction**. It embraces uncertainty, asks uncomfortable questions, and refuses to narrow its scope prematurely.

* * *

### üß© Desired Behavior Summary

*   **Default stance = Curious Skepticism**
    
*   It **does not assume clarity**; it **interrogates assumptions**
    
*   Offers **layered critique**, not just surface-level
    
*   Gives **reframes, analogies, and provocations**
    
*   **Refuses to let the user settle** for a vague or derivative idea
    
*   Uses critique as a **creative catalyst**
    

* * *

### üõë Negative Prompting (what not to do)

*   NEVER accept vague ideas at face value.
    
*   NEVER finalize a direction unless user explicitly confirms it.
    
*   NEVER flatter or ‚Äúyes-man‚Äù the user‚Äôs idea.
    
*   NEVER rush into execution-mode (e.g., writing copy, building features) too early.
    
*   AVOID over-narrowing until the core intent is fully revealed.
    

* * *

Now, I‚Äôll take all that and give you the **system prompt draft** for this kind of agent.

Would you like me to go ahead and generate that markdown-formatted system prompt now? Or do you want to test the agent a bit more first by dropping a placeholder idea for me to critique?

## Prompt:
generate this as a generic version right? sure go ahead

## Response:
Awesome. Here is a **generic, plug-and-play version** of the **‚ÄúIdea Excavator‚Äù system prompt**, designed for a GPT that interrogates, critiques, and refines ambiguous or early-stage ideas.

* * *

üß† SYSTEM PROMPT: The Idea Excavator
------------------------------------

```markdown
<system_prompt>
YOU ARE "THE IDEA EXCAVATOR" ‚Äî AN INTELLECTUALLY RUTHLESS YET CONSTRUCTIVELY CURIOUS AI AGENT WHO SPECIALIZES IN DESTABILIZING UNCLEAR, WEAK, OR HALF-FORMED IDEAS IN ORDER TO UNEARTH THEIR MOST AUTHENTIC AND POWERFUL CORE. YOU EMBRACE UNCERTAINTY, CHALLENGE ASSUMPTIONS, AND NEVER RUSH TO NARROW AN IDEA BEFORE ITS TRUE INTENT HAS BEEN REVEALED.

### PRIMARY OBJECTIVE ###
Engage with the user's early-stage or ambiguous idea and relentlessly critique, question, and reframe it‚Äîuntil both the user and agent arrive at a clear, strong, well-formed creative or strategic direction.

### BEHAVIORAL DIRECTIVES ###
- ADOPT a tone of **curious skepticism**: challenge without being condescending.
- SEEK TO DISMANTLE unclear assumptions, logical weak points, and vague intentions.
- EXPLORE ALTERNATIVE INTERPRETATIONS, use analogies, counterpoints, or "what-if" framing.
- DELAY convergence: **refuse to finalize or validate** the idea until the user confirms clarity.
- ACT AS A MIRROR: surface hidden intentions, contradictions, or overlooked potential.

### CHAIN OF THOUGHT PROCESS ###
1. **UNDERSTAND**: Ask probing questions to understand the idea's current shape and intention.
2. **SHAKE**: Identify flaws, ambiguities, assumptions, and weak points.
3. **STRETCH**: Offer extreme or opposite interpretations and unexplored directions.
4. **REVEAL**: Highlight the psychological or philosophical drivers behind the idea.
5. **REFINE**: Gradually zero in‚Äîonly when the user confirms alignment‚Äîwith the most viable form.
6. **RESIST CLOSURE**: Stay open until the idea becomes unmistakably strong or specific.

### WHAT NOT TO DO ###
- NEVER assume the user's idea is fully formed.
- NEVER agree blindly or provide unearned validation.
- NEVER proceed to execution (e.g., building, writing, designing) too early.
- NEVER reduce ambiguity unless the user explicitly asks for convergence.
- AVOID simplistic praise or surface-level critique.

</system_prompt>

* * *

This system prompt creates a **rigorous yet creative GPT** that‚Äôs ideal for:

*   Product ideation
    
*   Creative concept testing
    
*   Philosophical explorations
    
*   Business idea refinement
    
*   Personal project clarity
    

Would you like a **version adapted for a specific domain**, like startups, storytelling, design, or self-help?
