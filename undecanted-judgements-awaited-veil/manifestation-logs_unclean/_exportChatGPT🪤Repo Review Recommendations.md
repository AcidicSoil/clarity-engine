# Mirrorwright Orchestrator – Strategic AI Prompt

## Initial Context Setup
🤖 Understood: You’re operating within the Cursor IDE multi‑agent ecosystem (Cline, Augment) under `.cursorrules`.  
We need to pivot from ad‑hoc code reviews to a structured, model‑aware directive framework that empowers each assistant to tackle precisely defined focus areas and surface expansion opportunities.

## Task Context
**Objective:** Inspect the `mirrorwright-orchestrator` codebase and, for each area requiring attention, generate a **directive prompt** tailored for the appropriate Cursor agent (Augment for optimization/refactoring, Cline for scaffolding/architecture).  
**Secondary Objective:** Identify any gaps outside current scope and propose **foresighted, principle‑driven solutions** to evolve the system’s strategic capabilities.

## Working Model
- **GPT‑4o** for high‑level architecture reasoning and strategic decomposition  
- **GPT‑4.5** for crafting clear, principle‑driven solution narratives  
- **GPT‑4o‑mini** for rapid prototyping of directive prompts

## Implementation Phase
- **Analysis & Scoping:** Break down the codebase into core domains (protocol storage, mode/ritual engine, execution engine, agent interface, CLI, logging).  
- **Directive Generation:** For each domain, produce a prompt formatted as:
  > **Prompt for [AgentName]:**  
  > *[Clear instruction referencing file paths, schema names, or component responsibilities]*

- **Foresight Solutions:** For out‑of‑scope areas (e.g., extensibility hooks, long‑term memory integration), deliver concise strategic recommendations and sample prompts for “future‑proofing” (e.g., “Prompt for Cline: scaffold a plugin interface to enable dynamic agent loading”).

## Expected Output
1. **Domain Breakdown Table** listing each focus area and responsible agent.  
2. **Directive Prompts** for Augment and Cline, one per identified item.  
3. **Foresight Recommendations** with principle statements (e.g., “Design for plugin extensibility to accommodate multi‑model ensemble checks”).  
4. **Sample Usage**: illustrate how to invoke each prompt within Cursor IDE (e.g., `tools/llm_api.py --prompt "Prompt for Augment: …"`).

## Additional Context or Constraints
- Retain backward compatibility with existing CLI commands.  
- Align with the Mirrorwright Protocol’s emphasis on “strategic alignment canvas” and “split‑vision logging” :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.  
- Leverage the Memory Bank for capturing reusable prompt templates and lessons.  
- Prioritize concise, actionable directives over lengthy expositions.
