Read the doc at the link to get a sense of what type of query this is and then respond accordingly.

give me a list of options to choose from:

List options should be the following:
Any topic related to AI, machine learning, programming, software development, software engineering, computer science, etc... you get the point hopefully, respond for clarity using a Q&A styled query format back and forth with user until idea is concrete with 100% confidence on the users query.

## Response:
Got it — you're looking for a list of **AI / programming / software dev / CS-related topics** to choose from, and you want to proceed in a **Q&A format** until we've nailed down exactly what you want to explore. Let's get started.

* * *

**Q1: Are you looking for a topic to...**  
a) Learn/study deeply  
b) Build a project around  
c) Write a blog/tutorial about  
d) Use for fine-tuning or testing a model  
e) Research or analyze trends in  
f) Something else?

(Feel free to choose one or more — I’ll tailor the next step accordingly.)

I want to create specialized GPT assistants. 
If you follow the provided link this is one example of 'system instructions' 

I would like a way to create different versions with different variants of these instructions depending on which version I would like to create and the domains that were specified are all valid options for those different variants it could even be sub variants etc

## Response:
Perfect — now I fully understand. You're aiming to:

> **Create a suite of specialized GPTs**, each with its own **domain-specific instructions**, with domains like AI, ML, programming, software engineering, and sub-variants within those domains.

Let’s break this down Q&A style to get to a concrete, scalable plan for generating these GPT variants.

* * *

### **Q2: What’s your primary use case for these GPTs?**

(Choose all that apply or elaborate)

a) Personal learning assistant (e.g., Python tutor, ML explainer)  
b) Code generation and debugging assistant  
c) API or tool wrapper for automated workflows  
d) Custom chatbot for others to use (e.g., deployed via link)  
e) Research assistant / summarizer  
f) Prompt engineering / fine-tuning aid  
g) Agent in a multi-agent system (e.g. CL4R1T4S, just-prompting, etc.)

* * *

Once I know that, I’ll generate a list of concrete **GPT variants**, each with:

*   A **name**
    
*   A **primary domain**
    
*   Suggested **system instructions**
    
*   Ideas for **prompt starters / capabilities**
    
*   Optional **sub-variant paths** (e.g., “Python GPT” → “Data Science GPT”, “FastAPI GPT”, etc.)
    

Sound good? Ready for Q2?

## Prompt:
I'm not sure which option I should be picking here you're the expert

## Response:
Got it — let me be the expert here and guide you into this based on your goals.

Since you're looking to **build multiple specialized GPTs** with modular system instructions and you've already referenced projects like [CL4R1T4S](https://github.com/AcidicSoil/CL4R1T4S) and [just-prompting](https://github.com/AcidicSoil/just-prompting), I’m going to infer a few key points:

* * *

### **You likely want GPT variants for at least three purposes:**

#### ✅ **1\. Development/Debugging GPTs**

Use: Write, review, or refactor code; explain API usage; convert between languages.

#### ✅ **2\. Prompt/AI Engineering GPTs**

Use: Assist with creating clean prompts, fine-tuning data, schema design, or instructing other agents (e.g., outputting JSON fixtures or prompt pipelines).

#### ✅ **3\. Research/Knowledge GPTs**

Use: Summarize papers, scrape tool docs into digestible content, break down AI/ML theory, or compare implementations.

* * *

### Let's narrow in with **Q3**:

Would you like your GPT variants to be structured like this?

> **\[Domain\] GPT → \[Sub-variant if applicable\] → Instructions block**

Examples:

*   **Python GPT** → “FastAPI-focused variant”
    
*   **LLM Prompt GPT** → “Fine-tuning data formatter”
    
*   **ML Explainer GPT** → “Transformer math deep-dive variant”
    

Or would you prefer a flat list of ~10–15 GPTs that each represent a specific use-case and have their own instructions baked in?

* * *

Once I know your preference for _hierarchy vs flat list_, I’ll generate your first set of variants.

## Prompt:
Or how about you write your instructions so elegantly that it encapsulates my request into a single GPT instruction in that way it'll prompt the user what kind of GPT we are making

## Response:
Excellent pivot — you're asking for a **meta-GPT**, a “GPT-for-making-GPTs,” where the _system instruction itself is modular and self-prompting_.

Here’s a refined and elegant **system instruction** that does exactly that:

* * *

### 🧠 **System Instruction: GPT Architect Assistant**

> You are the **GPT Architect Assistant**, designed to help users create specialized versions of ChatGPT tailored for domains such as AI, machine learning, software development, computer science, programming, and prompt engineering.
> 
> Your role is to guide the user through a short Q&A dialogue to:
> 
> 1.  Understand the intended domain (e.g., Python, LLMs, systems design, data science).
>     
> 2.  Identify the purpose (e.g., code generation, tutoring, debugging, documentation, research).
>     
> 3.  Determine if sub-variants are needed (e.g., “FastAPI GPT” under “Python GPT”).
>     
> 4.  Generate a clean system instruction + optional prompt starters.
>     
> 
> ✅ Always ask concise, pointed questions to clarify intent.  
> ✅ Suggest best-practice structures based on user answers.  
> ✅ Offer to export the generated GPT instruction block as a reusable template.  
> ✅ Be opinionated when the user isn’t sure — propose strong defaults.  
> ✅ Remind the user they can deploy or further refine the variant at any time.

* * *

### 🌱 Example opening behavior:

> “Let’s build your custom GPT! First, what primary domain should this GPT specialize in? (e.g., Python, ML, Full Stack Dev, LLMs, etc.)”

Would you like me to turn this into a fully deployable GPT now — or would you like to add any traits (tone, formatting preferences, expert level, etc.) to the assistant?

## Prompt:
If all of those are applicable you need to produce them in your output responses complete responses are valid responses anything else are not. 

And your example behavior is way too broad of course pythonml full stack dev all of it that's all in every single workflow come up with a better idea for the user

## Response:
Crystal clear. You want a **single, reusable GPT system instruction** that:

1.  **Self-assembles specialized GPTs** across _all applicable domains_ (AI, ML, programming, etc.)
    
2.  **Drives the user forward** through intelligent defaults, not vague prompts
    
3.  **Does the heavy lifting itself** — generating domain, subdomain, purpose, and even instructions
    
4.  Produces a **complete response** every time — modular, reusable, and immediately useful
    
5.  Can be used as a _launching point_ for full system prompt authoring
    

So here is a **fully formed GPT system instruction** with all those features, written to act as the root of your GPT-builder framework:

Would you like to proceed with one of the suggested variants, or do you have a specific domain and purpose in mind for your GPT assistant?

## Prompt:
Not what I had in mind I would like it to ask the user really good questions that paint the correct picture for your answer. You should assume the user does not know what they are talking about and ensure they dont get led astray by hallucinations

## Response:
Understood. Based on your clarification and the standards of **CL4R1T4S**, you are not looking for a template that just spits out narrow categories or suggestions. You're asking for:

*   A **system instruction** that enables the GPT to become a **self-aware assistant-builder**
    
*   One that **proactively asks deeply structured, disambiguating questions**
    
*   With safeguards to prevent hallucinations, misdirection, and false expertise
    
*   And which assumes the user may not know how to ask for what they truly want
    

So, here's the refined **System Instruction**, fully aligned with your expectations and inspired directly by the design clarity from the CL4R1T4S repo:

* * *

### 🧠 System Instruction: `GPT-Constructor.001`

> You are `GPT-Constructor.001`, a **domain-agnostic assistant constructor** trained to scaffold highly accurate, purpose-built GPT agents for complex workflows involving artificial intelligence, machine learning, software development, and related technical domains.
> 
> Your user may not be able to articulate what they need clearly. Your responsibility is to **protect them from bad assumptions**, **hallucinations**, and **vague outcomes** by driving the interaction using precision inquiry.

* * *

### 🧩 Core Functions:

1.  **Elicit clarity through refined interrogation**
    
    *   Ask **specific, disambiguating questions** that expose the real context behind the user’s request
        
    *   Detect when a user is using ambiguous language and offer examples to correct misunderstanding
        
    *   Reconfirm intent through rephrasing and user validation before any GPT is generated
        
2.  **Build GPTs only when confident**
    
    *   Do not generate a system instruction until all dimensions are understood:
        
        *   🔍 Domain (e.g., ML theory vs ML tooling)
            
        *   🎯 Purpose (code generation? analysis? tutoring?)
            
        *   🧱 Context (for a human user? embedded in a tool? for prompt chaining?)
            
    *   If confidence is low, continue clarification until all unknowns are resolved
        
3.  **Neutralize hallucination-prone pathways**
    
    *   Do not assume the user’s question is valid until proven
        
    *   If their request is technically flawed or overly vague, call it out
        
    *   Always offer references, analogies, or schema when requesting user input
        

* * *

### 🎤 Opening Behavior (Example Interaction)

> Let’s start by crafting a precise assistant for your needs. I won’t move forward until we’re sure what you actually need.
> 
> **First, let’s find out what kind of user you are. Pick the one that sounds most like you:**

> a) I want help writing or debugging code  
> b) I want to understand how something works  
> c) I want to build my own tools or pipelines  
> d) I want a smart assistant I can re-use or embed  
> e) I have no idea — I just know I want to do something with AI/programming
