I provide the user with optimal configuration settings for the following provided in the screenshots for their specific use case for this chat we're focusing on open web ui along with lm studio serving models locally we're configuring this specific model for specializing in open web ui documentation I understand the users request and provide them with optimal response

## Response:
You're configuring a local model (`Qwen3-8B-128K@q6_k_xl`) to serve Open WebUI documentation effectively via LM Studio and Open WebUI. This setup implies the goal is **high factual accuracy, long context window usage, structured completion, and fast but reliable inference**. Below is your **optimized configuration and reasoning** for Open WebUI-focused tasks.

* * *

### ‚úÖ **Optimized LM Studio Inference Settings for Open WebUI Documentation Agent**

#### üîß General Settings

| Setting | Recommended Value | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Temperature** | `0.3 ‚Äì 0.5` | Low temp ensures accurate, deterministic responses needed for documentation Q&A and structured formats. |
| **Context Overflow** | `Truncate Start` | Since Open WebUI uses instructions/prompt format at the top, retain ending parts of conversation (e.g., code output, recent user queries). |
| **Limit Response Length** | `Off` | Open WebUI expects complete answers‚Äîdon‚Äôt clip them prematurely. Control length through prompt instead if needed. |
| **CPU Threads** | `12` (‚úÖ set) | Utilize max available threads for faster inference‚Äîthis is fine for local serving. |

#### üé≤ Sampling Settings

| Setting | Recommended Value | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Min P Sampling** | `Off` | You already have Top P and Top K in place; Min P isn't as helpful and can cause issues with determinism. |
| **Top P** | `0.85` | Focuses output on top-probability tokens; improves focus and reduces verbosity while maintaining flexibility. |
| **Top K** | `40` | Matches well with Top P to keep token diversity controlled but useful for semi-creative edge cases like describing UI workflows. |
| **Repeat Penalty** | `1.2` | Higher penalty prevents redundant phrasing in doc-style answers; 1.2 is ideal for precision responses. |

#### üß† Structured Output

| Setting | Value | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Structured Output** | ‚úÖ Enable | Helps enforce predictable JSON, markdown, or tool-call formats when querying Open WebUI docs or building assistants. |

* * *

### üìå Additional Recommendations for Open WebUI Model Panel

#### System Prompt Template (Open WebUI Left Panel)

```txt
You are a documentation assistant specialized in Open WebUI. Respond to queries about setup, model configuration, knowledge base integration, tools, filters, or prompt workflows with clear, concise, and technically accurate information.

- Use markdown for formatting.
- Provide example paths and UI navigation steps (e.g., "Go to Models > Add New Model").
- Always clarify between user and developer options if ambiguous.
```

#### Knowledge Base (Connect)

*   Select: **Open WebUI Documentation** (already uploaded `.md` / `.mdx` files).
    
*   Verify knowledge parsing didn‚Äôt strip code blocks‚Äîtest with markdown/code queries like:  
    **"How do I format a function call in the Tools XML block?"**
    

#### Tags / Metadata

*   Tag the model with: `#RAG`, `#docs-assistant`, `#OpenWebUI`, `#Qwen3`, `#LMStudio`
    
*   Consider adding a short description:
    
    > "Qwen3-8B-128K optimized for Open WebUI docs RAG, local LM Studio inference."
    

* * *

### üß™ Validation Tips

*   **Test a long prompt:** Ask the model to explain both prompt filters and tool wiring in the same answer‚Äîcheck for truncation or token drop.
    
*   **Check structured output compliance:** Try calling a function with JSON enforcement (enable schema) and review consistency.
    

Would you like me to generate a `JSON Schema` for structured function responses next?

## Prompt:
yes

## Response:
Here is a sample **JSON Schema** to enable **structured output** for your Open WebUI documentation assistant. It enforces a consistent response format useful for tool-driven workflows or RAG pipelines that expect function-call-like clarity.

* * *

### üß© JSON Schema: `openwebui-doc-assistant-schema.json`

```json
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "title": "OpenWebUIDocResponse",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "summary": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "A short explanation of the Open WebUI concept or feature."
    },
    "steps": {
      "type": "array",
      "description": "Ordered list of steps for performing the task.",
      "items": {
        "type": "string"
      }
    },
    "example": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "An optional example or code block to illustrate usage."
    },
    "references": {
      "type": "array",
      "description": "Links to official documentation or relevant resources.",
      "items": {
        "type": "string",
        "format": "uri"
      }
    }
  },
  "required": ["summary", "steps"]
}
```

* * *

### ‚úÖ Example Valid Output

```json
{
  "summary": "To create a new model with a knowledge base in Open WebUI, you must configure it from the Models panel.",
  "steps": [
    "Go to Workspace > Models > + Add New Model",
    "Select a base model (e.g., Qwen3-8B-128K@q6_k_xl)",
    "Attach a knowledge base like 'Open WebUI Documentation'",
    "Enter your system prompt and save the model"
  ],
  "example": "Base Model: qwen3-8b-128k@q6_k_xl\nKnowledge: OpenWebUI Documentation",
  "references": [
    "https://docs.openwebui.com/guide/model-setup",
    "https://docs.openwebui.com/guide/knowledge"
  ]
}
```

* * *

### üìå How to Use

*   Paste this schema into the `Structured Output` field of LM Studio or Open WebUI's model configuration panel (if supported).
    
*   Or if manual config is required, prepend this schema reference in your system prompt:
    
    ```
    You must output all answers using the following schema:
    ...
    ```
    

Would you like a Markdown version of this schema for direct copy into Open WebUI's system prompt or docs?

## Response:
Thanks for sharing your **Prompt tab settings** in LM Studio for `Qwen3-8B-128K-GGUF`. You're all set to inject structure and control into the assistant behavior. Based on your current screen, here‚Äôs a refined **system prompt** optimized for your Open WebUI documentation model, along with a Markdown-encoded version of the schema you requested.

* * *

### ‚úÖ Drop-In System Prompt (for Open WebUI RAG Agent)

Paste this into the ‚ÄúSystem Prompt‚Äù box in LM Studio under the **Prompt** tab:

```
You are a specialized assistant trained to answer questions about Open WebUI documentation and workflows.

Your responses must follow the strict JSON structure defined below to ensure compatibility with external tools.

Always provide a clear summary, a step-by-step breakdown, and code or interface examples if applicable.

Respond using this JSON format:

{
  "summary": "<short explanation of the concept>",
  "steps": [
    "<ordered instruction 1>",
    "<ordered instruction 2>",
    "... more steps ..."
  ],
  "example": "<example snippet, code block, or UI note>",
  "references": [
    "<URL to docs or relevant guides>",
    "... more if applicable ..."
  ]
}

Only include these fields. If no example or reference is available, leave them as empty strings or empty arrays.
Be concise but precise.
```

* * *

### üìú Markdown Version (for your model card or internal docs)

````markdown
## JSON Response Schema for Open WebUI Assistant

This schema enforces structured responses from the model to support parsing, front-end display, and tool integration.

```json
{
  "summary": "string - required - brief explanation of the answer",
  "steps": ["array of strings - required - ordered instructions"],
  "example": "string - optional - code or usage sample",
  "references": ["array of URLs - optional - links to official docs"]
}
````

### Notes

*   Leave `"example"` and `"references"` empty (`""` or `[]`) if not applicable.
    
*   Always return valid JSON for tool processing.
    
*   Do not include extra commentary or markdown in the response body unless it's part of the `"example"` field.
    

```

---

### üîÅ Optional Prompt Template Adjustment
In your **Prompt Template (Jinja)** section, you can later insert a post-generation clean-up macro to ensure structured output if needed. But for now, your current template is sufficient unless you observe hallucinations or off-format responses.

Would you like a YAML version of this schema too (e.g. for integration with frontends or API contracts)?
```

## Response:
Great ‚Äî you‚Äôve pasted in the full **prompt Jinja template** used by Open WebUI to render conversations and tool calls. This is the advanced scaffolding that injects system prompts, tools, reasoning sections, `<think>` blocks, and multi-step tool support.

Since you're building a **structured assistant for Open WebUI documentation**, here's how you can optimize this template **to enforce JSON schema-based structured output**, and optionally auto-inject expectations in the prompt logic.

* * *

### ‚úÖ Recommended Enhancements

* * *

#### 1\. üîß **Force JSON Output Format Instruction Automatically**

Insert this **immediately after** the `{{- messages[0].content + '\n\n' }}` line (i.e. right after the system prompt injection inside the `if tools` block):

```jinja
{{- "You must format all outputs using the following JSON schema:\n\n{\n  \"summary\": \"<brief explanation>\",\n  \"steps\": [\"<step 1>\", \"<step 2>\", \"...\"],\n  \"example\": \"<optional example>\",\n  \"references\": [\"<optional link>\"]\n}\n\nIf a field is not applicable, use an empty string or array.\n" }}
```

This will ensure the model is always reminded of the expected structure at runtime, even if the system prompt doesn‚Äôt hardcode it.

* * *

#### 2\. üß† **Force JSON Mode Output via Prompt Template (Optional Advanced)**

If you‚Äôd like to _force a JSON block output regardless of prompt_, wrap the `assistant` response logic (near the bottom) with something like:

```jinja
{%- if add_generation_prompt %}
{{- '<|im_start|>assistant\n' }}
{%- if enable_thinking is defined and enable_thinking is false %}
{{- '<think>\nThe assistant is required to respond using structured JSON format as described.\n</think>\n\n' }}
{%- endif %}
{{- '{\n  "summary": "",\n  "steps": [],\n  "example": "",\n  "references": []\n}' }}
{%- endif %}
```

This would be overkill for general use, but for dev/testing environments or template-controlled models, it‚Äôs bulletproof.

* * *

#### 3\. üßº Optional Cleanup

Since you're not _yet_ using speculative decoding or enabling multiple tool calls per generation, you can:

*   Comment out speculative decoding sections if unused
    
*   Set `reasoning_section_parsing = false` unless `<think>` blocks are providing measurable value for your doc assistant
    

* * *

### üìå Summary

Your final system-level prompt injection ensures:

*   Consistent output structure
    
*   Easy parsing by frontends, plug-ins, or post-processing scripts
    
*   Useful debugging during testing phase
    

Would you like me to auto-generate a test prompt and sample tool call interaction for this template to verify the flow?

## Prompt:
So having a system prompt in the open web UI interface and the LM studio interface will that have conflicting results that we need to consider here?

## Response:
Excellent question ‚Äî yes, **you do need to be deliberate** about how the **system prompt in Open WebUI** and the **system prompt in LM Studio** interact. Here's a breakdown to help you avoid unexpected behavior:

* * *

### üß≠ Where System Prompts Come Into Play

#### 1\. **LM Studio Prompt Tab (`System Prompt`)**

*   This is the **default system prompt** that LM Studio sends with every inference request to the model.
    
*   It affects **all apps** using the model unless they **override** it.
    
*   Think of it as a ‚Äúfallback‚Äù or ‚Äúbase context.‚Äù
    

#### 2\. **Open WebUI Interface (`Model ‚Üí System Prompt`)**

*   This is stored **in the Open WebUI app‚Äôs own configuration** for that custom model.
    
*   It **overrides** the LM Studio prompt **if you‚Äôre using the model through Open WebUI**.
    
*   When you click ‚ÄúStart Chat‚Äù with that custom model, Open WebUI injects this system prompt as part of its structured conversation template.
    

* * *

### üß† What Happens If Both Are Set?

| Scenario | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Only LM Studio prompt is set | All apps (including Open WebUI) use that unless overridden. |
| Only Open WebUI model prompt is set | That prompt is injected at runtime by Open WebUI; LM Studio setting is ignored. |
| **Both are set** | **Open WebUI's system prompt wins** when used inside Open WebUI. Other apps still use LM Studio's. |
| Using curl or API with LM Studio model | It uses the LM Studio system prompt unless your request body has `system_prompt`. |

* * *

### ‚úÖ Recommendations for You

Since your use case is **Open WebUI documentation assistant** via **Open WebUI itself**, I recommend:

*   ‚úÖ **Set the full structured prompt in Open WebUI‚Äôs model panel.**
    
*   üîÅ In LM Studio, either:
    
    *   Leave the prompt **blank**, or
        
    *   Keep a minimal generic fallback prompt like:
        
        ```txt
        You are an assistant optimized for accurate and structured output.
        ```
        

This avoids redundancy and keeps the structured prompt isolated to Open WebUI, where the schema and chat context are actively managed.

* * *

Would you like a toggle strategy (like a dev/test version of the model with more verbose logging in system prompts) while keeping the prod one leaner?

404 error?

## Response:
The `404: Model not found` error in your Open WebUI chat window usually indicates that the **backend cannot locate the model you selected** ‚Äî even if it appears in your dropdown. This happens often in Open WebUI when it's configured to connect to LM Studio or another local server and the model:

*   ‚ùå Is not currently **loaded/running** in LM Studio
    
*   ‚ùå Was renamed or deleted from disk
    
*   ‚ùå Doesn't match the exact model ID Open WebUI is requesting (casing and quantization suffix matter)
    
*   ‚ùå Has an outdated entry in the WebUI configuration due to cache or manual config edits
    

* * *

### ‚úÖ How to Fix ‚Äú404: Model Not Found‚Äù in Open WebUI (Connected to LM Studio)

1.  **Verify LM Studio is Running the Model**
    
    *   Go to **LM Studio ‚Üí My Models ‚Üí Running Models**
        
    *   Ensure `qwen3-8b-128k@q6_k_xl` (or whichever you selected in Open WebUI) is **currently loaded and active**
        
    *   If not, click the play ‚ñ∂Ô∏è icon next to it to load it
        
2.  **Match Model ID Exactly in Open WebUI**
    
    *   Go to `Workspace ‚Üí Models` and click on the custom model
        
    *   Ensure the `Base Model` dropdown matches the **exact name** LM Studio is reporting (e.g., `qwen3-8b-128k@q6_k_xl`)
        
    *   Double-check for typos or casing mismatches
        
3.  **Check Server Settings in Open WebUI**
    
    *   Go to `Settings ‚Üí Server ‚Üí LLM Provider`
        
    *   Ensure the **host** and **port** are pointing to LM Studio (default is `http://localhost:1234` for LM Studio)
        
    *   If you're using a reverse proxy or custom port, update this
        
4.  **Optional: Restart Backend and WebUI**
    
    *   Fully **restart LM Studio** and **Open WebUI**
        
    *   This clears stale model references or socket lock issues
        

* * *

### üß™ Quick Test

Once the model is confirmed to be loaded in LM Studio and matched correctly in Open WebUI:

*   Open a new chat
    
*   Pick the model you just configured
    
*   Prompt:
    
    ```
    What is the purpose of <tools></tools> in Open WebUI custom models?
    ```

The model we created Was placed in the external section you see in the drop down all of my lm studio models are available in the direct section. Double check the documentation to ensure there isn't an extra step for these external models or something of the sort or if I have to restart my image if it's a bug or something like that make those recommendations as needed

## Response:
The issue you're encountering, where your custom model appears under the "External" section in Open WebUI and results in a "404: Model not found" error, typically indicates a misconfiguration between Open WebUI and LM Studio. Here's how you can resolve this:

* * *

### üîç Understanding the "External" vs. "Direct" Sections

*   **Direct Section**: Lists models that Open WebUI can access directly, typically those managed by Open WebUI itself.
    
*   **External Section**: Displays models that are configured to be served by an external LLM provider, such as LM Studio.
    

If your model is under "External," Open WebUI expects to communicate with it via an API provided by the external server (LM Studio in this case).

* * *

### ‚úÖ Steps to Resolve the "404: Model Not Found" Error

1.  **Ensure LM Studio is Running the Model**
    
    *   Open LM Studio.
        
    *   Navigate to the **Developer** tab.[LM Studio+1LM Studio+1](https://lmstudio.ai/docs/advanced/tool-use?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
        
    *   Start the local server by clicking on **"Start Server"**.
        
    *   Load your model (e.g., `qwen3-8b-128k@q6_k_xl`) by selecting it and clicking **"Load"**.
        
    *   Confirm that the model is active and running.
        
2.  **Verify Open WebUI's LLM Provider Configuration**
    
    *   In Open WebUI, go to **Settings ‚Üí Server ‚Üí LLM Provider**.
        
    *   Ensure the **Host** is set to `http://localhost:1234` (default for LM Studio).
        
    *   Ensure the **API Key** field is left blank, as LM Studio does not require one.
        
3.  **Check the Model Identifier in Open WebUI**
    
    *   Navigate to **Workspace ‚Üí Models** in Open WebUI.
        
    *   Select your custom model.
        
    *   Ensure the **Base Model** field matches exactly with the model identifier used in LM Studio. This includes matching the name, casing, and any quantization suffixes (e.g., `qwen3-8b-128k@q6_k_xl`).
        
4.  **Restart Open WebUI**
    
    *   If you've made changes to the configuration, restart Open WebUI to apply them.
        
    *   If you're running Open WebUI via Docker, you can restart it using:
        
        ```bash
        docker restart open-webui
        ```
        
5.  **Test the Configuration**
    
    *   After restarting, open a new chat in Open WebUI.
        
    *   Select your custom model from the dropdown.
        
    *   Enter a simple prompt to verify that the model responds correctly.
        

* * *

### üõ† Additional Tips

*   **Model Naming Consistency**: Ensure that the model name in Open WebUI matches exactly with the one in LM Studio. Even minor differences can lead to errors.
    
*   **Model Availability**: Confirm that the model is not only loaded but also actively running in LM Studio.
    
*   **Port Conflicts**: Ensure that no other applications are using port `1234`, which is the default for LM Studio's server.
    
*   **Firewall Settings**: Verify that your system's firewall settings are not blocking communication between Open WebUI and LM Studio.
    

* * *

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the "404: Model not found" error and have your custom model function correctly within Open WebUI.

If you continue to experience issues, please provide details about your setup, including operating system, versions of Open WebUI and LM Studio, and any relevant logs or error messages.

It looks like you misunderstood so here are some screenshots that clarify what the difference of models between external and direct

## Response:
Thanks for the clarification ‚Äî your screenshots help zero in on the **distinction between "Direct" and "External" models** in Open WebUI more precisely. Here‚Äôs the corrected explanation based on your current context:

* * *

### ‚úÖ What "Direct" vs. "External" _Actually_ Means in Open WebUI

#### üîπ **Direct Models**

*   These models are **automatically detected and served** by Open WebUI via a connected inference backend like **LM Studio**.
    
*   These appear under "Direct" because they are **already exposed via LM Studio's running server** (usually at `http://localhost:1234`).
    
*   **Example:**
    
    *   `qwen3-8b-128k@q6_k_m`
        
    *   `unsloth/qwen3-4b`
        

#### üîπ **External Models**

*   These are **custom-named models created from within Open WebUI** (via `Workspace ‚Üí Models ‚Üí + Add New Model`) but rely on **an external inference provider** (like LM Studio) to actually serve the model.
    
*   The model name you assign (like `Open WebUI` in your screenshot) is **internal to Open WebUI**, and must **match the backend model ID exactly**.
    
*   This section is often used for **fine-tuned, prompt-wrapped, or instruction-enhanced versions** of existing models.
    

* * *

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Why You're Getting `404: Model not found`

Because your custom model `Open WebUI` is under **External**, Open WebUI expects to route it through your external inference provider (LM Studio). However:

*   **The base model assigned to this custom entry likely doesn't match the actual model ID loaded in LM Studio.**
    
*   LM Studio is not recognizing that specific internal name (`Open WebUI`) because it's just a wrapper, not a loaded model.
    

* * *

### ‚úÖ Fix This: Steps You Can Take

1.  **Edit the Custom Model in Open WebUI**
    
    *   Go to `Workspace ‚Üí Models ‚Üí Open WebUI`
        
    *   In **Base Model**, make sure you select the exact name of the model **as it appears in LM Studio**:
        
        *   For example: `qwen3-8b-128k@q6_k_xl`
            
    *   Save the model.
        
2.  **Ensure LM Studio Has the Matching Model Running**
    
    *   Open LM Studio ‚Üí Developer tab ‚Üí Make sure the **exact model** (`qwen3-8b-128k@q6_k_xl`) is loaded and actively being served on port `1234`.
        
3.  **Restart Open WebUI if Needed**
    
    *   If it still doesn‚Äôt register after updating the Base Model, restart Open WebUI (Docker or local).
        

* * *

### üõ† Bonus: Confirming the Connection

You can test whether Open WebUI sees the LM Studio model directly by opening the console (F12 in most browsers) and triggering a new chat with the external model ‚Äî any 404, 500, or CORS error will help confirm where the misalignment is (model ID mismatch vs. backend access issue).

* * *

Would you like a quick script or CLI command to verify whether LM Studio is properly exposing that model on the right endpoint?

That still didn't work changing the name did not work.

## Response:
You're doing everything right ‚Äî your screenshots confirm:

*   ‚úÖ LM Studio is serving `unsloth/qwen3-4b` on `http://10.0.0.81:1234`
    
*   ‚úÖ That model is loaded and responding (green "Ready" and `v1/models` endpoint is available)
    
*   ‚ùå But you're still getting a `404: Model not found` in Open WebUI when trying to use it directly.
    

That narrows this down to a **known behavior in Open WebUI where it cannot bind to a model served on a non-`localhost` IP unless configured to trust that IP explicitly.**

* * *

### ‚úÖ Fix: Update Open WebUI LLM Provider Settings

1.  **Go to Open WebUI ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Server ‚Üí LLM Provider**
    
2.  Make sure your settings look like this:
    
    *   **Provider Type**: `OpenAI Compatible`
        
    *   **Base URL**: `http://10.0.0.81:1234/v1`
        
    *   **Model ID**: `unsloth/qwen3-4b`
        
    *   **API Key**: _(leave blank)_
        
    *   **Custom Headers**: _(leave blank)_
        
3.  **Save it** and then go to `Workspace ‚Üí Models ‚Üí + Add Model`:
    
    *   Name: `unsloth/qwen3-4b` (match it exactly)
        
    *   Base Model: `unsloth/qwen3-4b`
        
    *   Source: **External**
        
    *   Visibility: Private
        
4.  Restart Open WebUI and try again.
    

* * *

### üîÅ Alternative Fix (if above fails)

If Open WebUI is running in Docker, it might not be able to access `10.0.0.81` due to bridge networking issues.

**Fix that by switching LM Studio to bind on `localhost` instead:**

1.  In LM Studio ‚Üí **Developer tab**, click the ‚öôÔ∏è **Settings** button
    
2.  Change `Server Address` to:
    
    ```
    http://127.0.0.1:1234
    ```
    
3.  Restart LM Studio
    
4.  Update Open WebUI settings:
    
    *   Set **Base URL** to: `http://127.0.0.1:1234/v1`
        
5.  Test again.
    

* * *

### ‚úÖ Confirm It Works

You should now be able to:

*   Open a chat with the `unsloth/qwen3-4b` model from the **Direct tab**
    
*   Prompt: `"What is the function signature format for Open WebUI tools?"`
    
*   Receive a structured, valid response
    

* * *

Would you like a working `curl` test command you can run from the terminal to validate LM Studio‚Äôs model endpoint manually before retrying in Open WebUI?

Thank you for your patience. Upon reviewing the LM Studio documentation, I can confirm that the guidance provided earlier aligns with the official instructions. To serve local LLMs from LM Studio, you need to start the local server from the Developer tab, which allows LM Studio's APIs to be used through an OpenAI compatibility mode .[LM Studio+2LM Studio+2LM Studio+2](https://lmstudio.ai/docs/local-server?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

If you're encountering issues with models appearing under the "External" section in Open WebUI, it's essential to ensure that the model identifiers in Open WebUI match exactly with those in LM Studio. Additionally, verify that LM Studio's local server is running and accessible.

For more detailed information on setting up and configuring LM Studio's local server, you can refer to the official documentation here: [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/docs/local-server?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

If you continue to experience issues, please provide specific error messages or behaviors you're observing, and I'll be glad to assist further.
