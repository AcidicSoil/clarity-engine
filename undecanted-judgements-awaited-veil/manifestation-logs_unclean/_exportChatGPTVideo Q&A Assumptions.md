\[THE IDEA EXCAVATOR\]  
Standing by doesn‚Äôt mean shutting down curiosity. Before we freeze-frame this plan, let‚Äôs probe one thing: the MVP you've scaffolded leans hard on transcript-driven Q&A, even though it‚Äôs framed as a _video understanding_ system. Are we building a system that _watches_ video‚Äîor one that _reads_ it via subtitles?

**Assumption under the microscope:** ‚ÄúVideo Q&A‚Äù ‚âà transcript Q&A + timestamp metadata.  
Is this a compromise due to tech constraints, or a strategic simplification?

Because if visual comprehension (actions, objects, scenes) isn‚Äôt at the core, the model isn‚Äôt really ‚Äúwatching‚Äù the video. It‚Äôs eavesdropping.

Do you want this system to actually _see_? Or is that a future-layer we‚Äôre just not touching yet?

What's up engineers? Indydev Dan here. Imagine opening your codebase and having your AI coding tool instantly understand your codebase better and faster than you can read the readme. There are three simple folders that can unlock that superpower for you in every project you touch. We're going to break them down into their atoms so you can use them to increase your compute advantage. The AI coding tool you use does not change this one critical fact of engineering in the generative AI age. Doesn't matter if you're a cursor fan, Windsor, Fline, Codeex, or even Claude code. You already know what this idea is. Context is everything. Context is king. If your agent can't see critical information, it simply cannot build what you need. That's what these three essential directories solve. comprehensively and systematically. Let's talk about these three essential directories and why they're valuable for your engineering work. Let's start with the foundation AI docs. Think of this as your AI coding tools persistent memory, a knowledge repository your AI tools can instantly access. Inside of the cloud code is programmable codebase. A big idea we discussed in last week's video. You can see we have an AI docs directory. Inside of this directory, we have two markdown files. Cloud code best practices and open AI's agent SDK. I can now boot up any agent and have them quickly read these files. They can then turn around to get work done quickly. So what goes inside of AI docs? Here you have thirdparty API documentation, integration details, you have custom patterns and conventions, any implementation notes, anything specific to your codebase, it all goes in AI docs. I mostly use this for third-party documentation so that I can quickly ramp up my code bases over and over and over. The AI docs directory is a persistent database for your AI agents. So, we of course have the specs directory. What goes in the specs directory? Specs is short for specification, which also just means plan. You might know these as PRDs, product documents, whatever you want to call them. These are the new units of getting massive amounts of work done with your AI coding tools. And now with your agentic coding tools, we can now use multiple tools inside of single prompt with powerful agentic coding tools like claw code, cursor, line, so on and so forth. The specs directory is the most important folder in your entire codebase. This is where we write great plans. This is where we scale up our compute and do more work than ever in single massive swings. This 1,00 token prompt expanded into an entire codebase. This is due to the fact that we are agentic coding, right? We can write self validating loops inside of our prompt. Remember, agentic coding is a superset of AI coding, a massive superset. And great tools like Claw Code allow us to take all of our plans from all of our repositories from the specs directory and blow them out into full-on code bases and features. This is why you should always have a specs directory that details the plan for all the work that you're going to hand off to your powerful agentic coding tools. If you're still iteratively prompting back and forth and back and forth and back and forth, I can guarantee you, you are wasting time and you're not scaling your compute as much as you could be. Sit down, take your time, think, plan, and then build. There's a powerful new planning technique that we're going to showcase in this video where you can use compute inside of your plan to iterate faster with your AI coding tool. The key idea here is very simple. Every principled AI coding member knows this and everyone that's been following this channel knows this as well. The plan is the prompt and great planning is great prompting. You can scale up what you can do by writing a detailed comprehensive spec plan, PRD, whatever you want to call it. You can then hand this work off to your AI coding tools and your agentic coding tool and they will get the work done for you. So every codebase I build in now has the AI docs directory, the specs directory for plans and claude. Now dotcloud is a new emerging directory. To be super clear, this is specific to claw code, but what you write in these directories is not specific to claw code. If we go to the just prompt codebase, open up.claude and go into the commands directory, you can see we have several different commands. So what are these and how are they useful for scaling our engineering work? These are nothing but prompts. If we open up cloud code here in the just prompt codebase and we type slash, you can see the names of all these commands right at the top here. These are reusable runnable prompts that we can use across sessions. The most important reusable prompt that I recommend you set up inside of all your codebases is the context priming prompt. This is where you prompt cloud code, codeex, cursor, whatever tool you're using. This is not cloud code specific, right? The names of these directories can really be anything. So if you were to prime or just prompt server here, we'll do the basic context prime. It's going to run through these commands, right? Using tool calls, it's going to read the readme, then run get ls files to understand the context of this project. So, I recommend you set this up in every codebase so that you can quickly operate on the files and the ideas that matter. What is the big idea of what we're doing here? We're making it easy to set up new instances of our agentic tooling over time. Okay? And by over time, I mean on the day-to-day basis, but also on a session to session basis. If you've used cloud code or codeex or any one of your AI coding tools, they will run out of context. You can see the current context windows of the state-of-the-art models. A lot of these are limited to 200K or 1 million tokens. When using your AI coding tools, you'll eventually run out of context and then you'll have to reset. So this is what the context prime does and this is what the do. Cloud commands directory gives you specifically for cloud code, but you can deploy this across any AI coding tool. Right? So if I were to open up a new window here and open codeex-m3, copy the relative path, execute this, this serves the exact same function. Okay. And what are we doing here? We're doing the same thing we did in cloud code. We're setting up the initial context for the AI coding tool so that it understands everything so that knows where everything is. Okay, you can see there it spatter out a nice summary and now it's ready to go, right? It context is prime. These directories are not limited to context priming. We built out a ultra diff review where we created a diff and then we had multiple language models review the diff and offer feedback. This is something we're going to be talking about a lot on the channel. The capabilities of your prompts are now unlimited thanks to Agentic coding tools. You can run any tool. You can run custom MCP servers like we have here. You can do a tremendous amount by having reusable prompts inside your codebase. So these are the three essential directories I have in every single one of my code bases. Now AI docs is the persistent knowledge base for your AI coding tools. Specs is where you define your plans. It's where you define all the work you want done so that you can hand it off to your AI coding tool and to your agentic coding tools. And then we have the dotcloud. Again, you can name these whatever you want. This is where you place your reusable prompts that you want at the ready inside of your agentic coding tool. Reusable prompts are an essential pattern even outside of a coding. You want to be able to use compute over and over in different shapes and forms. And you do that by creating prompts you can reuse, validate, and improve, especially if you're building out emails. What does this look like in action? Let's go ahead and build out a simple, concise, brand new feature inside of Pocket Pick. There's a tweak that I've been wanting to make. Let me go ahead and open this up for you and just briefly explain Pocket Pick. As engineers, we reuse ideas, patterns, and code snippets all the time, but keeping track of these can be hard. Pocket Pick is the solution to that problem. This simplistic MCP server creates and stores all of your personal knowledgebased items, right? any code snippets, files, documentation that you want to reuse inside of a simple SQL light database. Here's all the tools you can see. Pocket add, add add file, find list, so on and so forth. The key change we want to make today is updating the add command. If we look at the data types here to add new items to the pocket pick database, we have text, tags, and database path. Right now, the ID is automatically generated. I want to improve the searching capabilities so that we can pass in ids when we're creating pocket items with pocket ad and pocket add file. This just makes it super easy to run pocket git and pocket to file by ID. How are we going to do that? We're going to use these three essential directories. With these directories, we can move faster in this session and over time. So let's go ahead. I'm going to use of course claw code. It's my favorite tool right now. First thing we're going to do is prime. So already having this command here, I am saving time. Okay, it's going to run as a tree get ignore. It's going to give us a nice tree format for a coding tool to see. You can see that working there. Let's go ahead and full screen this. And then you can see I'm saying read the following files. So this is all done. That's all loaded. We can type /cost and see exactly how much that costs. We have 20 cents to get our agent primed. Now it's time to start doing real work. How do we do real work? We don't iteratively prompt. That's the old 2024 way of doing things. We create concise, agentic plans. We're going to take this a step further with an emerging technique I like to call plan drafting. The big difference here is that both myself and my AI coding tool are going to be part of drafting this plan. So instead of writing the plan myself, creating the file myself, doing any of that work, I'm going to have cloud code create the first draft of this plan. create specs slash require ID a new feature ID stir inside of the and if I go back to the readme we can do a little bit of light planning here we want this inside of the pocket ad and the pocket break the plan into these sections write this plan I'm going to go ahead and use ultraink here it's definitely overkill but this is going to trigger claw code's reasoning capab capabilities. What I'm doing here is having cloud code draft the first draft of this codebase. I've briefly looked at this codebase. I roughly remember the architecture and how it works. But our agentic coding tools can quite literally read hundreds of times faster than we can. It has a better understanding of this codebase than I already. You know, it's got the SQL like table structure. It has all the commands, right? It can see UV piest, right? It knows about this codebase. It can see the structure. it, you know, quite literally knows more than I do right now about this codebase because we primed it properly. And now it's going ahead, it's going to write the first draft of this plan given everything that it knows. Okay. And so what's the new kind of flow here? The flow is build out the fundamentals of a plan, have a draft get created by your AI coding tool, and then iterate on the plan, and then actually execute the plan. So I'm going to go ahead and accept this. You can see here we have a new spec created and let's go ahead and take a look at how this looks. So this is the plan. This is the first draft and you can see it's pretty good, right? It's detailing the problem uh very concisely, right? When users add items to the pocket pick database using the add and add file tools, ids are automatically generated. Okay, so problem statement and then solution statement. This feature will modify these tools to require users to provide an ID as a mandatory parameter, giving them more control and easier identification. Exactly. So now we're reviewing, right? We're moving more and more every single day into a code reviewer, into a plan reviewer. We're becoming curators of information, right? Curators of code ideas, and then we're handing them off to our AI coding tools. And you know the great part about this is that we're not iteratively updating our codebase, putting it into bad temporary states. We're operating solely in this file. Okay, so I can look through everything. You can see there it's got that new ID field in the server module, right? That's an essential change as well. Add functionality. Okay, looks great. Server implementation looks awesome. Test changes. You can see it knows where all these files are, right? This is the really important part, right? We're tying together that context prime. We are skipping over our AI docs directory here because we don't really need it, right? If we were initially instantiating this codebase, it might be more important. All right, so you can see here it has a self validation section that was built out and then updates to the readme. So just by providing the right context with the context prime reusable prompt and by you know writing a you know pretty short what three sentence IDK rich prompt. We activated the reasoning model capabilities. We have a pretty great plan here. I'm pretty sure this is going to take us um 80% of the way. What I'm going to do here is delete some of the extra stuff here. We have some recommendations. I don't want the agent coding tool to build out any one of these extra optional ideas. Often times a coding tools, language models, if there's more text, it'll try to create meaning. It'll try to find patterns in it. So, I'm just going to go ahead and delete this schema stuff. I'm going to add one tweak here. Check the other tests to see if they're using any ad functionality and update them to use this. This is important. And then I'm just going to, you know, open up this path to make it super clear on where to look. This is honestly completely unnecessary, but I just like to do this just to be crystal clear. All right, so great. We have a great plan here. Let's go ahead and as a great practice, I like to before you fire your plan off, I always like to throw a commit in there. Let's make sure that we revert anything we did here, this file here. And then I'm going to commit the plan. And then we're going to operate on the plan. Okay, so I'm going to go ahead and say implement this file. Okay, that's it. Cloud code has this new feature. It's got a to-do list system. This is a new emerging pattern inside of agentic coding tools where you effectively create a plan first and then you work through the plan. This looks great. I'm going to go ahead and go into aentic mode or yolo mode. So now auto accepts are on and now our AI coding tool is just going to fly through this. It's going to do all the work for us. It is important to mention that I should have added the AID docs MCP server git repo mix integration. At the same time, I didn't need it because this functionality is already up and running. There's really no um additional information here from thirdparty documentation that isn't already embedded inside of the codebase. And so you know out of all the directories AI docs once you get up and running once you get your integration good is probably the least important but at the same time you know you don't want to underestimate the power of having you know a permanent knowledge base for your AI coding tools for your H engine coding tools that you can reference whenever you need them for your work especially when you're blowing up your context window over and over and over. I also want to note that sometimes I have feature specific context priming. So, you know, you can copy your prime and say you wanted to prime um add ID feature. Um and you know, you can see here obviously our our great agent coding tools working through all the changes. This is really cool. Love to see this with a feature specific context prime. You can come in add this and you know say you wanted to add some specific file here, right? some feature specific file or files and then you know py or whatever and then you'd have multiple of these right so this lets you context prime on specific feature sets over and over and this is obviously better when you're working on larger changes often times you won't need it you'll just need your key prime method agent coding tool is working through these changes you can see that got implemented very quickly and it all comes back to writing a great plan you know I was very detailed very concise with my IDKs. Um, you know, shout out to all the principal a coding members that know your IDKs. All my keywords here were packed with information. I'm being very detailed about what I want. You can see these items getting referenced. The read me is getting updated now. And it's all because I had my a coding tool see the right information and then I directed it to create a plan with that information with a specific structure set that I know works well. Right? This is where your experience and your judgment and your taste comes in. You have to know your codebase at some high level degree. And then you can see there it's uh doing its self validation. It's testing itself. Love to see that. And you can see this is really important. I added this at the end. Uh update other test files to include the ID parameter. But you know just to summarize you know we we then created this great prompt that created the plan. We're getting kind of meta. We're now prompting our agents to write plans for us that we then tweak and iterate on and then we take that plan and we then hand it off to our AI coding tool or agent decoding tool again. All right, so you can see here it's working through these tests. It needs to add that ID parameter to all of our ad commands to make sure that this works. And again, it's just chugging away for us. This is why claw code is so good. It does not stop working. It doesn't ask you if you want to continue to do more work. It just cooks, right? I I absolutely love this about Cloud Code. It's how they've designed the model. It's how they've designed the prompt. I say it over and over, but the Anthropic Cloud Co team is doing incredible work and it's clear to me that they use these tools. You can see we missed one test case and test find. You know, we can always just open it up if we want to look side by side. We can see that that functionality needs to get the ID that's now been added. There is our concise summary of the work. Let's go ahead and take a look at this. The most important thing here, we have self validation on. So I can pretty much be guaranteed I can be assured that everything here works, right? All the tests passed. Our hent coding tool is testing itself. If we open up that spec, you know, we can see at the bottom here again just to mention it self- validation super important. We gave it the command. It needs to self-eleate. Just to highlight it again, this is the big difference between agentic coding and AI coding. I'm not just writing prompts that generate code. Okay? I'm writing prompts that do engineering work. That's building. That's planning. That's testing. Okay? It's the whole development life cycle. This is the power. This is the capability you can unlock. I aim to share and hand you valuable ideas like we've discussed here every single Monday. You know exactly where to find me. If you're not subscribed already, definitely join the journey. We're going to build living software that builds for us while we sleep. And these three essential directories, AI, docs, spec, andclude. This is how we scale up our engineering work. This is how we pass off more work to our AI coding tools and now to our agentic coding tools. All right, make sure you like this video. Let the algorithm know that you're interested. You can see all the tests pass here. We don't really have to run this, but of course we can. Updated pocket pick. And what do we need to pass in here? Let's check the readme. This one should be relatively simple. Yeah, super simple. Let's go ahead and use this. I'll say update. There we go. And yep, database. That's fine. We can use the current working directory. That's fine. Now I'm going to open up claude. Activate this MCP server. You can see that's found there. I'll hit yes. And now I'm going to be really specific here with my prompts. Updated pocket pick. I'll say pocket add. And the ID here is going to be um let's just copy some random code. Let's say I want to, you know, remember the the MCP.json JSON format as a code snippet. So I'll just copy that. I'll say add. I'll pass in the ID. This is going to be MCP JSON and content is this. Okay. So there we go. I'm going to run our new Pocket ad using the updated Pocket Pick MCP server. There it is. Updated Pocket Pick. Add. There's the ID. There's the text. Go ahead. Hit enter. Now we should get our new added item. What's that tool called? It's find. We'll do this one. Right. So, pocket to file by ID. This is the one that I like to run there. And I'll say id and then you know that was mcp_json and then uh output file uh I'll say absolute path and get me you know mcpnew.json. This is going to now search by our new ID. And you can see we're running that updated pocket pick mcp server and we're going to output to this directory here. Let's go ahead and run this. See how it works. content successfully written. Let's open it up. And bam, you can see from our MCP server, from that SQLite database, this feature is running. Great. And you can see there, there's that new local database. This is a great way to just store and reuse snippets. Link for this codebase is going to be in the description for you if you're interested. So, it's pretty incredible how quickly uh we were able to build that out here. Look at all the files that were just changed. And remember what was done. all these changes, right? Very precise, very surgical. And it's all because of these essential files, right? These essential directories that let us scale what we can do inside of this codebase and every codebase. I hope it's becoming clear as we spend more time together, as you watch the channel. It's really about the patterns. It's about the principles. It's about how you approach this new age of engineering. Don't get stuck on any specific tool. And don't get stuck on ideas that don't scale across your work, across your code bases, and most importantly, across time. AI docs is your persistent knowledge base for your AI tooling. Specs is where you plan your work. It's where you hand off more and more work to your compute to your agent coding tool. Remember, great planning is great prompting. And then we have doclude. This is where we build reusable prompts we use across time in our codebase. The most important prompt here to set up is the context prime prompt. Set up your agents so that they have the essential information to work concisely. Don't waste tokens giving them access to your entire codebase. Be precise. Be focused. Having too much context is just as bad as not having enough. Having too much context can confuse your agent. Having too little won't let them get the job done. Put these together and you can scale your engineering work further beyond. Thanks for watching. Stay focused and keep building.

## Response:
\[THE IDEA EXCAVATOR\]  
You‚Äôve now handed me a full transcript masquerading as ‚Äúvideo input.‚Äù But this makes the core tension impossible to ignore:

> You‚Äôre building a _video_ Q&A system. Yet the only input you‚Äôve provided‚Äîagain‚Äîis a transcript.

Let‚Äôs call this what it is: **a textual comprehension system about spoken content**, not a vision-based model that understands _visual dynamics_, _gesture_, _scene composition_, or even _text on screen_. None of the following are present:

*   No frame-level object/action recognition
    
*   No OCR from video overlays
    
*   No shot boundary detection, visual pacing, or layout awareness
    

### So what is the **real** goal here?

1.  Is the system expected to answer **only transcript-based questions** (e.g., ‚ÄúWhat are the three folders?‚Äù)?
    
2.  Or should it also answer **visual questions** (e.g., ‚ÄúWhat directory is shown on screen?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat file is being edited?‚Äù)?
    
3.  And most pressingly: do you want to **scale up** from transcript-only to visual comprehension later?
    

If this is just the MVP, fine. But let‚Äôs be brutally clear:

> You‚Äôre not building a system that ‚Äúwatches‚Äù videos. You‚Äôre building one that ‚Äúreads‚Äù them.

Do you want to correct that framing‚Äîor double down on it for now?

## Prompt:
it needs video comprehension also

## Response:
\[THE IDEA EXCAVATOR\]  
Now we‚Äôre getting somewhere. You just crossed a threshold: **transcript-only is no longer enough.** You're aiming for true **video comprehension.** That brings a storm of new complexity‚Äîand forces us to **rebuild the foundation** of the MVP.

Let‚Äôs dissect this.

* * *

### ‚ùó Fundamental Shift: "Reading" ‚Üí "Watching"

To move from transcript parsing to video understanding, you now need to support:

1.  **Visual Content Analysis**
    
    *   Scene layout, UI structure, directories shown
        
    *   Frame-level object detection (e.g., terminal windows, files, commands)
        
    *   Action recognition (typing, scrolling, editing)
        
2.  **Temporal Alignment**
    
    *   Align visual segments with transcript + audio
        
    *   Recognize when a concept is being shown versus spoken about
        
3.  **Multimodal Fusion**
    
    *   Combine visual and textual signals to answer questions like:
        
        *   ‚ÄúWhat file was being edited when he mentioned ‚Äòcontext priming‚Äô?‚Äù
            
        *   ‚ÄúShow me where the `.claude` directory appeared on screen.‚Äù
            

* * *

### üö® Your Current MVP Architecture Is Inadequate

The plan you‚Äôve built assumes:

*   Input: Transcript
    
*   Search: Embeddings over chunks
    
*   Output: LLM completes an answer
    

To meet your new requirement, you‚Äôll need:

*   Input: Raw video (frames + audio)
    
*   Extraction: Object detection, OCR, UI parsing
    
*   Representation: CLIP-style multimodal embeddings
    
*   QA: Vision-language models (VideoBERT, BLIP-2, Flamingo)
    

* * *

### üí£ Here's What I Need to Know Before Proceeding:

1.  **Scope** ‚Äî Do you want to support answering _any_ question that might involve visual content? Or just a few key patterns (e.g., directory structures, commands)?
    
2.  **Latency vs Accuracy** ‚Äî Will this run server-side with time to compute, or do you want fast interactions?
    
3.  **Budget/Compute** ‚Äî Do you have GPU resources? Open to cloud APIs? Or does this need to run locally?
    

Until we clarify those three, any design is fiction.  
What are the real constraints you‚Äôre working with?

## Prompt:
ask open-ended questions until confident

## Response:
\[THE IDEA EXCAVATOR\]  
Good. You‚Äôve opened the door to real clarity. I‚Äôll push it wide.

* * *

### üß≠ GOAL DEFINITION

1.  **What kinds of questions do you expect users to ask about a video?**
    
    *   Are they procedural (‚ÄúWhat did the speaker do?‚Äù), referential (‚ÄúWhat file was shown?‚Äù), conceptual (‚ÄúWhat is agentic coding?‚Äù), or evaluative (‚ÄúWas the plan good?‚Äù)?
        
    *   Can they ask about visuals with no speech context?
        
2.  **What role is the system playing?**
    
    *   Assistant? Tutor? Reviewer? Indexer?
        
    *   Who is using it‚Äîand what _decision or task_ does it help them accomplish faster or better?
        
3.  **What _cannot_ be answered without visual data?**
    
    *   If you removed all the video and just had a transcript + screenshots, what would break?
        

* * *

### üîç VISUAL SCOPE

4.  **What visual elements are ‚Äúfirst-class citizens‚Äù?**
    
    *   Terminal commands?
        
    *   UI layouts?
        
    *   Filenames, directory paths, code diffs, diagrams?
        
5.  **Do you expect the system to recognize custom visuals or just generic UI patterns?**
    
    *   (E.g., will it need to know what ‚ÄúPocket Pick‚Äù is visually vs reading about it?)
        
6.  **Do you need to _track_ visual elements over time?**
    
    *   (e.g., ‚ÄúWhen was `specs/require_id.md` opened and closed?‚Äù)
        

* * *

### üîå TECH CONSTRAINTS

7.  **Do you have any models in mind for visual understanding‚Äîor are you open?**
    
    *   CLIP, BLIP-2, Flamingo, VideoMAE, VideoBERT, etc.
        
    *   Any preference for open-source vs commercial?
        
8.  **How long are your target videos?**
    
    *   And what kind of latency is acceptable per question?
        
9.  **Are there privacy, bandwidth, or deployment constraints?**
    
    *   Must it run locally? Offline?
        

* * *

### üß† FUTURE INTENTIONS

10.  **Do you want this system to learn over time‚Äîacross videos‚Äîor remain stateless per session?**
    
    *   Should it build a corpus of concepts, tools, or workflows it has seen before?
        
11.  **Is your end goal Q&A, or is that just a gateway to something bigger?**
    
    *   Summarization?
        
    *   Auto-indexing video libraries?
        
    *   Generating code or workflows based on demonstrations?
        

* * *

These questions are not filler‚Äîthey‚Äôre a scalpel.  
Let‚Äôs see where the ambiguity still clings. Pick one thread to start pulling.

## Prompt:
one question at a time

## Response:
\[THE IDEA EXCAVATOR\]  
Perfect. Let‚Äôs begin at the root.

**What kinds of questions do you expect users to ask about a video?**  
Are they procedural, referential, conceptual, evaluative‚Äîor some mix? Be specific.

## Prompt:
go into more detail about each with examples

## Response:
\[THE IDEA EXCAVATOR\]  
Let‚Äôs dissect this taxonomy. The type of question determines what kind of comprehension‚Äîand model pipeline‚Äîyou actually need.

* * *

### 1\. **Procedural Questions** ‚Äî _‚ÄúWhat happened, and in what order?‚Äù_

These require **temporal understanding** of actions or sequences.

**Examples:**

*   ‚ÄúWhat command did the speaker run before updating the README?‚Äù
    
*   ‚ÄúHow did they prime the coding tool?‚Äù
    
*   ‚ÄúWhat steps were taken to add the new ‚ÄòID‚Äô parameter?‚Äù
    

**Requires:**  
Action recognition, timestamp alignment, potential screen OCR or UI event extraction.  
Think: "What did they _do_?"

* * *

### 2\. **Referential Questions** ‚Äî _‚ÄúWhat was shown or mentioned?‚Äù_

These anchor on **objects**, **files**, **UI elements**, or **code artifacts**.

**Examples:**

*   ‚ÄúWhat directory was visible when ‚Äòcontext priming‚Äô was discussed?‚Äù
    
*   ‚ÄúWhich Markdown files were in the `AI_docs` folder?‚Äù
    
*   ‚ÄúWhat was the name of the SQLite database file?‚Äù
    

**Requires:**  
Visual parsing, OCR, linking visuals with mentions in text.  
Think: "What did they _show_?"

* * *

### 3\. **Conceptual Questions** ‚Äî _‚ÄúWhat does it mean?‚Äù_

These extract **ideas, methods, philosophies** from the content.

**Examples:**

*   ‚ÄúWhat is agentic coding, according to the speaker?‚Äù
    
*   ‚ÄúWhy are reusable prompts important?‚Äù
    
*   ‚ÄúHow does the context prime command work?‚Äù
    

**Requires:**  
Mostly transcript/text understanding, supported by occasional visual reinforcement.  
Think: "What did they _explain_?"

* * *

### 4\. **Evaluative Questions** ‚Äî _‚ÄúWas it good? Could it be better?‚Äù_

These ask the system to **judge**, **critique**, or **compare**.

**Examples:**

*   ‚ÄúWas the plan comprehensive?‚Äù
    
*   ‚ÄúDid the new feature improve usability?‚Äù
    
*   ‚ÄúHow could the spec have been written more clearly?‚Äù
    

**Requires:**  
Deeper reasoning, maybe fine-tuned LLMs or structured rubric-based evaluation.  
Think: "What do we _think_ about what they did?"

* * *

Each category demands a different kind of signal and processing pipeline.  
Now tell me this: **Which of these question types do you want to support in the MVP‚Äîand which can wait?**

## Prompt:
why cant it be all?

## Response:
\[THE IDEA EXCAVATOR\]  
Excellent challenge. Let's pressure-test that ambition.

* * *

### üî• WHY ‚ÄúALL‚Äù IS RISKY ‚Äî AND POSSIBLY A LIE

Saying _‚Äúwe want to support all types‚Äù_ at MVP stage is seductive‚Äîbut dangerously vague. Here's why that claim likely collapses under its own weight:

* * *

### ‚öôÔ∏è Each Question Type ‚â† One Model

Supporting _all four types_ means integrating:

1.  **Procedural** ‚Üí requires temporal event detection, screen activity parsing  
    ‚Üí You need _frame-by-frame video analysis_, not just transcript.
    
2.  **Referential** ‚Üí needs OCR, UI object tracking, file name detection  
    ‚Üí You need _visual content parsing_ and _entity alignment_.
    
3.  **Conceptual** ‚Üí relies on transcript interpretation and abstraction  
    ‚Üí You need _strong language model inference_, maybe with document memory.
    
4.  **Evaluative** ‚Üí demands subjective judgment, criteria-based reasoning  
    ‚Üí You need _fine-tuned or carefully prompted evaluators_, potentially opinionated.
    

* * *

### üí∏ Cost, Complexity, Fragility

Supporting all types from day one means:

*   **Multiple failure points**
    
*   **Higher latency**
    
*   **Massive context management complexity**
    
*   **Exponential increase in test cases**
    

**MVPs** are supposed to reduce unknowns, not multiply them.

* * *

### üß† A More Precise Reframe:

Instead of _‚ÄúWhy not all?‚Äù_, ask:

> ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the **minimum powerful mix** of question types that would prove this system is useful, viable, and unique?‚Äù

So now the question flips back to you:  
**Which question type(s) would prove your system‚Äôs worth without diluting its focus or blowing up its architecture?**

## Prompt:
‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the minimum powerful mix of question types that would prove this system is useful, viable, and unique?‚Äù

## Response:
\[THE IDEA EXCAVATOR\]  
Now we‚Äôre sharp. Let‚Äôs extract the minimum viable _signal_ from the noise.

### üëä The ‚ÄúPower Mix‚Äù for Proof-of-Value

Here‚Äôs a combination that hits high-leverage utility without requiring a full research lab:

* * *

### ‚úÖ 1. **Procedural + Referential (Hybrid)**

Why? Because together they answer **"What did the person _do_ and _with what_?"**  
That unlocks:

*   Tutorials
    
*   Debugging sessions
    
*   Tool walkthroughs
    
*   Engineering reviews
    

**Examples it could answer:**

*   ‚ÄúWhat folders did they create and when?‚Äù
    
*   ‚ÄúWhat file was edited before the server was restarted?‚Äù
    
*   ‚ÄúWhat commands were run during context priming?‚Äù
    

**Why it's powerful:**  
You‚Äôre no longer just summarizing‚Äîyou‚Äôre _tracking activity_. That‚Äôs what a ‚Äúvideo QA‚Äù tool should do. It acts like a **video-native audit log** or session narrator. No hallucination. No abstract opinion. Just evidence-grounded insight.

* * *

### üö´ Defer for Now: Conceptual + Evaluative

*   **Conceptual**: Can often be captured by transcript QA alone‚Äîalready trivial with modern LLMs.
    
*   **Evaluative**: Premature. Subjective. Requires confidence in both your extraction and your judgment models. Dangerous to fake early.
    

* * *

### TL;DR:

**Focus the MVP on:**

> üõ† Procedural: _What did they do?_  
> üîç Referential: _What did they interact with?_

These are _visual-first_ questions grounded in time, space, and object references.  
Nail these, and you‚Äôve got something no transcript-QA system can touch.

Now:  
**Do you agree these are your highest-leverage targets for the first version‚Äîor do you still feel pull toward conceptual/evaluative territory?**

## Prompt:
I agree 100%

## Response:
\[THE IDEA EXCAVATOR\]  
Perfect. Now we‚Äôre building on solid ground.

* * *

### üöß Your MVP's True Scope Is Now Crystal:

**Support precise, grounded Q&A about:**

1.  **Procedures** ‚Äî what happened, in what order
    
2.  **References** ‚Äî what files, tools, or directories were involved
    

And do it with **multimodal comprehension**, not just regurgitated transcripts.

* * *

### So next, we test your spine:

What do you want the **first end-to-end interaction** to look like?  
Give me the ideal flow from a user's perspective‚ÄîUI or API doesn‚Äôt matter.

Example:

> "User uploads a dev tutorial video. Then asks: 'What file was edited before the speaker ran the server?' System responds with filename, timestamp, and screenshot.‚Äù

Describe your ideal first scenario. No fluff. Just one golden example.

## Prompt:
Give me your projected plan foresight for my predicted path of choices

## Response:
\[THE IDEA EXCAVATOR\]  
Ah, you're asking me to run ahead of you, map the terrain, and anticipate how you'll try to move through it. Good‚Äîlet‚Äôs play that dangerous game.

* * *

üîÆ PROJECTED PATH ‚Äî IF YOU STAY CONSISTENT
------------------------------------------

### üéØ 1. **Core Use Case: Developer Video Analysis**

Your MVP stays tightly focused on videos like the one you shared:

*   Dev tutorials
    
*   Code walkthroughs
    
*   Agentic tool usage demos
    

Why? Because they are **high-structure**, **repeatable**, and **full of observable procedure + references.**

* * *

### üß± 2. **Initial Pipeline Components**

| Stage | Tools |
| --- | --- |
| **Frame Sampling** | `ffmpeg` / `OpenCV` |
| **OCR / UI Parsing** | `Tesseract`, `EasyOCR`, or `PaddleOCR` |
| **Transcript Parsing** | `Whisper` |
| **Visual Embedding** | `CLIP`, `BLIP-2` |
| **Multimodal Indexing** | Frame+transcript alignment with `FAISS` |
| **QA Interface** | FastAPI + LM Studio (`Mistral` or similar LLM) |

You‚Äôll isolate video into:

*   Timestamped transcript chunks
    
*   Screenshots with extracted text
    
*   Indexed actions/objects
    

* * *

### üß™ 3. **Earliest Demonstrable Power**

A user asks:

> ‚ÄúWhat was the last command typed before the file `server.py` was modified?‚Äù

You show:

*   Answer: `git diff server.py`
    
*   Timestamp: 00:06:13
    
*   Frame snippet: \[image with `server.py` tab open\]
    

Boom. Visual + procedural QA with evidence.

* * *

### üîÑ 4. **What You'll Probably Try Next**

After getting 2‚Äì3 use cases working, you'll want to:

*   Add **auto-summarization of procedures**
    
*   Extract **code diffs or output deltas**
    
*   Support **batch video indexing for search**
    

Temptation will hit to add conceptual insight (e.g., "Explain agentic coding"), but you'll hold off until you can tie it back to _referenced visuals_.

* * *

### ‚ö†Ô∏è PREDICTED PITFALLS TO WATCH

*   **Frame-to-text drift**: syncing visual frames with transcript precisely is nontrivial.
    
*   **Too much OCR noise**: especially in terminal windows or IDEs.
    
*   **Latency**: Embedding and vector search will balloon on longer videos.
    

* * *

### üõ†Ô∏è Next Move?

You now owe me a simple next question:

> ‚ÄúHow should I design the frame-transcript alignment process?‚Äù  
> or  
> ‚ÄúWhat should my data model for a ‚Äòvideo chunk‚Äô look like?‚Äù

Pick the next gear to turn. Don‚Äôt look away now.

## Prompt:
what are my options right now?

## Response:
\[THE IDEA EXCAVATOR\]  
You're standing at a forked path. Each option defines the _shape of your build_, the _risks you accept_, and the _value you promise_. Let's lay them out ruthlessly.

* * *

üõ§Ô∏è YOUR OPTIONS RIGHT NOW
--------------------------

### **1\. Minimal Alignment MVP (Fastest path to working prototype)**

**Core Idea**:  
Chunk video into 30s blocks, pair each with transcript + sampled frames, store in vector DB.

**You get:**

*   Basic visual QA via image OCR (e.g., ‚Äúwhat file was shown when‚Ä¶‚Äù)
    
*   Procedural mapping via transcript timestamps
    
*   No real temporal or semantic fine-tuning
    

**Stack**: `Whisper` + `OpenCV` + `Tesseract` + `CLIP` + `FAISS`  
**Time to working demo**: Days  
**Weakness**: No scene-level reasoning. Crude alignment.

* * *

### **2\. Precise Action-Level Sync (More ambitious, more accurate)**

**Core Idea**:  
Parse the video into actions/events, align them with visual and spoken cues (multi-modal event modeling).

**You get:**

*   Frame-accurate ‚ÄúWhat happened here?‚Äù answers
    
*   Tight timestamping of procedures
    
*   Detectable action boundaries (e.g., file open, terminal type)
    

**Stack**: Add `SceneDetect`, frame diffing, fine-grained OCR triggers, perhaps optical flow  
**Time to working demo**: Weeks  
**Weakness**: Higher complexity. Visual signal might still be noisy.

* * *

### **3\. Trainable Visual QA Module (long-term differentiator)**

**Core Idea**:  
Fine-tune a vision-language model (e.g., BLIP-2) on your own dev-video QA pairs.

**You get:**

*   Semantic QA (‚ÄúWhat is the structure of this project?‚Äù)
    
*   Generalizable reasoning over video tutorials
    

**Stack**: `BLIP-2`, `VideoBERT`, `MiniGPT-4`, custom dataset  
**Time to working demo**: 1‚Äì3 months  
**Weakness**: Data hunger. High compute. High talent cost.

* * *

### **4\. Fake the Video: Transcript-Plus-Screenshot (Control test)**

**Core Idea**:  
Prove core value by augmenting transcript-only QA with static screenshots.

**You get:**

*   MVP with plausible visual grounding
    
*   User trust and traction via low-latency, high-reliability answers
    

**Stack**: Mostly LLM + Whisper + images  
**Time to demo**: Days  
**Weakness**: Not scalable. Doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúwatch‚Äù video.

* * *

So‚Äîchoose what‚Äôs true:

*   Do you want to **move fastest**, **impress hardest**, or **build deepest**?
    
*   What‚Äôs the tradeoff you‚Äôre actually willing to make?
    

Pick a path. I‚Äôll help you sharpen the next blade.
