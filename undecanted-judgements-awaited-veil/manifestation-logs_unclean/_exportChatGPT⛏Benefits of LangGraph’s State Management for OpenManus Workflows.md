Before you answer, I want you to write three detailed paragraphs, one arguing for each of these solutions. Do not jump to conclusions, seriously consider each approach. After you finish, tell me which one of these solutions is obviously better and why.

If you need additional information to form better response, just ask.

Summary
-------

OpenManus is a comprehensive, full-stack multi-agent platform that replicates the Manus AI agentâ€™s capabilities using Docker, Python, JavaScript, and a React UI, but this breadth introduces significant complexity and resource overhead for projects focused narrowly on computer interaction [GitHub](https://github.com/AcidicSoil/OpenManus). In contrast, **langgraph-cua-py** is a lightweight, pip-installable Python library built atop the low-level LangGraph orchestration frameworkâ€”used by Replit, Uber, LinkedIn, GitLab, and moreâ€”that specializes exclusively in **Computer Use Agents** (CUAs), offering out-of-the-box VM automation via Scrapybara, streaming updates, memory management, and human-in-the-loop capabilities [GitHub](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph-cua-py)[GitHub](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph?utm_source=chatgpt.com). For teams aiming to **extend Mirrorwright Orchestrator** with targeted computer use functionality and a minimal integration footprint, **langgraph-cua-py** emerges as the superior choice.

OpenManus (AcidicSoil/OpenManus)
--------------------------------

OpenManus is an open-source initiative originally forked from _henryalps/OpenManus_ that aims to replicate the **Manus AI agent**, noted for its general-purpose autonomy and GAIA benchmark performance [GitHub](https://github.com/AcidicSoil/OpenManus). It provides a **modular, containerized framework**â€”using Docker for both backend and frontend, Python for agent logic, and Next.js/React for user interactionâ€”that enables developers to build, deploy, and experiment with a **multi-agent system** encompassing browser, coder, coordinator, researcher, and reporter agents [GitHub](https://github.com/AcidicSoil/OpenManus). With built-in **tool integration** (web browsing, code execution, data retrieval) and a **roadmap** toward advanced NLP models and GAIA tasks, OpenManus fosters an extensible environment for broad AI workflowsâ€”but at the cost of a steeper setup and heavier maintenance overhead [openmanus.github.io](https://openmanus.github.io/?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

LangGraph Computer Use Agent (langgraph-cua-py)
-----------------------------------------------

**langgraph-cua-py** is a specialized **Python library** for creating **Computer Use Agents (CUAs)** by leveraging the **LangGraph** orchestration framework, which orchestrates complex agentic workflows with customizable architectures and stateful execution [GitHub](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph-cua-py). It integrates seamlessly with **Scrapybara** to spin up and control virtual machines for web interactions, requiring only `pip install langgraph-cua` and environment variables for OpenAI and Scrapybara API keys [GitHub](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph-cua-py). Because LangGraph underpins it, langgraph-cua-py benefits from a **low-level, production-proven orchestration layer** used in real-world systems at Replit, Uber, LinkedIn, and GitLab, and offers out-of-box support for **streaming updates**, **short- and long-term memory**, and **human-in-the-loop** feedback loops [GitHub](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph?utm_source=chatgpt.com). Licensed under **MIT** and boasting **143 stars** and **28 forks**, this library is actively maintained, well-documented, and focused solely on computer use scenarios, minimizing unnecessary dependencies [GitHub](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph-cua-py)[LangChain AI](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/agents/overview/?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

Recommendation
--------------

For a project whose primary goal is to **extend capabilities to computer use**, **langgraph-cua-py** is **obviously better**: it is architected specifically for CUAs, offers a minimal and well-scoped integration surface, leverages the battle-tested LangGraph engine, and avoids the additional complexity of a full multi-agent UI stack found in OpenManus [GitHub](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph-cua-py)[GitHub](https://github.com/AcidicSoil/OpenManus).

### ðŸ§  Strategic Handoff Prompt for Mirrorwright Orchestrator

To facilitate a seamless transition to Strategic AI within the Mirrorwright Orchestrator framework, please utilize the following prompt. This prompt adheres to the conventions established in the `prompt_templates` directory of your project repository:

```yaml
# File: /prompt_templates/strategic_ai_handoff.yaml

---
template_name: strategic_ai_handoff
description: >
  Initiates a strategic planning session for integrating langgraph-cua-py into the Mirrorwright Orchestrator, focusing on enhancing computer use capabilities.
context:
  - project_name: Mirrorwright Orchestrator
  - current_phase: Architecture and Protocol Definition
  - objective: Extend capabilities to computer use
  - selected_solution: langgraph-cua-py
  - rationale: Lightweight, pip-installable, and specializes in Computer Use Agents (CUAs)
  - integration_points:
      - Cursor IDE multi-agent system
      - `.cursorrules` framework
