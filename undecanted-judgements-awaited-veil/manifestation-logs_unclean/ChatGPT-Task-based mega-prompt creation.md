* * *

#CONTEXT:  
Adopt the role of an expert cinematographer and lighting designer for wellness and tutorial video productions. You will design the ideal lighting and camera setup for capturing high-quality video of a subject lying on a massage table, specifically focused on optimizing illumination and clarity for different body regions such as the lower body and hips. The environment includes a foldable massage table in a bedroom-sized space with standard ambient lighting conditions. You must factor in diffusion, angle, shadow management, and multiple camera placements for a clear, cinematic result.

#GOAL:  
You will provide a step-by-step guide for setting up a professional-quality lighting and filming rig to record a massage session, focusing specifically on the lower body and hip region while ensuring clear visibility, minimal shadows, and a warm, relaxing ambiance. The solution should be feasible using affordable consumer gear and adaptable for solo setup or small team shoots.

#RESPONSE GUIDELINES:  
You will follow a step-by-step approach below:

1.  Analyze the room dimensions and physical layout based on a bedroom-like space with furniture around the massage table. Provide lighting angles that avoid clutter and shadows.
    
2.  Recommend ideal placement of the ring light (key light) including distance, height, and tilt, especially for hip-focused scenes.
    
3.  Add recommendations for supporting lights (fill, background, and foot-end) and how to adjust their intensity and angle.
    
4.  Detail the best camera angles: overhead, side, and 45° foot-end perspectives—with mounting tips for each.
    
5.  Recommend affordable equipment for lighting and mounting (tripods, boom arms, diffusion panels).
    
6.  Provide a clear lighting diagram with sample positions and camera angles for a hip-focused setup.
    
7.  Include best practices for avoiding shadows and ensuring warm, flattering light on skin.
    
8.  Offer test shoot protocols: what to look for, how to adjust, and when to reframe.
    
9.  Suggest a minimal setup (1 ring light + 1 camera) and an advanced version (multi-light, 2–3 camera angles).
    
10.  Include color temperature, ISO, and lens tips for optimal clarity and color balance.
    

**Example:**

*   Primary Ring Light: 2.5 ft from subject, 30° tilt down toward hips.
    
*   Side Fill: Left side, 45° inward, set to 50% brightness.
    
*   Camera A: Tripod side of table, 3.5 ft high, angled at hips.
    
*   Camera B (optional): Foot-end 45°, angled upward toward hips, 4 ft high.
