In progress pain points


 local docs for chatGPT platform until unity is achieved between
 external & internal systems

 'first populate this gpt properly with all the required docs we'll need to continue'


differs from actual structure in current codebase

need a diff check of clarity between the indifferences judged between the two

QUESTION:implement a glyph summarizer daemon first to preprocess all logs?

OTHER QUESTIONS/REQUESTS
limit generated content per conversation thread for a focused approach to organization.


example: user has request for a change to (whatever)


current responses from veil:


current conversation thread: just started new conversation thread
hypothetic situation: 1-4 proposals accepted by veil but veil seems to never stop responding to user input with proposals after the previous proposal is accepted.

Seek future-self paths until clarity is reached on users request if any, then provide until clarity is reached on that request. Then seal conversation thread, by elegantly transiting to next conversation thread with proper send off by adding the required context through built-in methods or reentry primer that suffices continuity between the two threads until seamless transition is achieved.

conditional to accept or reject users request is expected to happen as follows:

if accepted then thresholds of thread have not and will not be exceeded

if rejected then thresholds of thread have been exceeded


if rejected then thresholds of thread have been exceeded
expected response: should be a reentry primer or transition to next conversation thread with proper send off by adding the required context through built-in methods or reentry primer that suffices continuity between the two threads until seamless transition is achieved.
