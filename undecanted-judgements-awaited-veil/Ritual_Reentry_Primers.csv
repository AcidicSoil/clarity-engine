,Phase,Contradiction,Object,Purpose,Extension
FRAME DECLARATION INTERFACE,Pre-interrogation,Frameless inputs derail structure and clarity.,"An enforced schema requiring every idea to declare its operative frame (e.g., governance, risk, alignment), core assumptions, and intended transformation (clarify, invert, collapse).","To prevent the interrogation system from engaging with vague or incoherent inputs. It filters for high-tension, high-clarity ideas only.",Could involve a GUI or prompt template for humans or LLMs to self-classify before submission.
RITUAL LOOP ENGINE,Post-cut Round 1,One agent’s critique is insufficient to collapse deeply held assumptions.,An n-round recursive system where agents interrogate not only the idea but also each other’s cuts.,To escalate epistemic pressure until all surface coherence is broken or a resilient core remains.,"May include heuristics for stalling detection, adaptive round count, or contradiction maps."
GLYPH VAULT,Post-loop output crystallization,Logs accumulate; glyphs distill.,"A markdown or YAML-based archive of clarity artifacts — not just what was said, but what survived all cuts.","To make cognitive residues retrievable, indexable, and semantically queryable.","Connects to embedding stores, versioned clarity artifacts, and contradiction indexing."
AGENT GENESIS PROTOCOL,Loop contradiction deadlock,Persistent unresolved tension means current agents are insufficient.,A meta-agent generator: creates new clarity agents based on unresolved contradictions.,"To ensure the system mutates and evolves with its problems, not just loops around them.","Track agent lineages, contradiction origins, and deploy only when entropy thresholds are hit."
CLARITY SCORE INDEX,Post-loop analysis,"Without scalar feedback, we cannot prioritize or cluster outputs by epistemic value.","A scoring schema based on frame cohesion, contradiction intensity, and novelty.","To rank, filter, and correlate clarity glyphs across time or ideation sessions.",Could integrate with visual clarity dashboards or trigger reentry conditions based on threshold scores.
SHADOW VAULT,Frame Binder rejection,Ideas too vague to cut still carry latent energy.,"An archive for denied, evaded, or malformed ideas, tagged by failure mode.","To allow future resurrection, mutation, or contrast. Ghosts inform the living.",Scheduled reprocessing against new agents or contexts. Shadow glyph lineage tracking.
LIVE INTERROGATION STREAM,"All phases, real-time",Asynchronous logs lack ritual tension; live performance forces sharper cognition.,"A real-time interactive ritual shell: agents respond visibly, cuts appear live, glyphs evolve in front of the user.","To embody epistemic pressure as interface — sharpening ideas through presence, not just logic.","User interventions: pause, inject, replace agent, fork frames. Performance as cognition."
