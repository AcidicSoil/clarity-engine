# Cursor IDE — Ritual Integration

## Purpose
- Main coding/agentic work environment for clarity-driven projects.
- Temporary until custom IDE is forged (to eliminate subscription costs).

## Ritual Compliance & Logging
- All significant agentic actions (code refactor, AI-assisted resolution, test suite invocation) should be manually logged to `/ritual_manifest/spells.log.json`.
- Use local script or extension to export project commit summaries to the ritual log.

## LM Studio Acceleration
- If using Cursor’s AI or Copilot-like features, set backend model to LM Studio by specifying API endpoint in Cursor’s plugin/config panel.
- Recommended: Llama-3-70B-Instruct, GPT-4o, or model of choice per ritual clarity guide.

## Session Boundary
- Cursor does **not** preserve clarity logs unless configured.
- Export logs or “summaries” after each session for RMLP compliance.

## Best Practices
- Use `veil`, `cast`, `cut`, `log` short-hands in commit messages and code comments for cross-system traceability.
- Regularly backup `.vscode/`, `.cursor/`, and `/ritual_manifest/`.
